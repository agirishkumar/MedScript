 sound, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision in the right eye, dizziness upon standing, and slight neck stiffness. There is no significant past medical history and no known allergies. The patient is not currently taking any medications.

2. Possible Diagnoses:
Primary Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)
Differential Diagnoses: Migraine, Temporal Arteritis, Cervical Spondylosis, Meningitis

3. Reasoning Process:
a) SAH: The sudden onset of severe headache, particularly unilateral, along with photophobia and phonophobia, raises concern for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nausea and vomiting suggest increased intracranial pressure. Blurred vision may indicate papilledema due to elevated ICP. Neck stiffness could signify meningeal irritation.
b) Migraine: Though migraines can cause severe headaches, bilateral symptoms are more typical; however, unilateral pain is possible. The presence of other neurological symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision makes migraine less likely.
c) Temporal Arteritis: This condition typically affects older patients (>50 years), and while it can present with headache, photophobia, and neck pain, the absence of fever and systemic symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.
d) Cervical Spondylosis: Although it can cause neck pain and stiffness, the acute nature of the headache and associated neurological symptoms do not strongly support this diagnosis.
e) Meningitis: Infection would typically present with fever, which is absent here. However, meningismus (neck stiffness) supports the possibility of a central nervous system infection like meningitis.

4. Recommended Tests or Examinations:
a) CT scan without contrast – To rule out acute intracerebral hemorrhage, evaluate for hydrocephalus, and assess for signs of meningitis or encephalitis.
b) Lumbar puncture – If CT scan is negative but clinical suspicion remains high for subarachnoid hemorrhage, lumbar puncture should be performed to analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for blood, xanthochromia, or elevated opening pressure.
c) Complete Blood Count, Electrolytes, Renal Function Test – To rule out systemic infections or metabolic causes.
d) Ophthalmologic evaluation – Assess for papilledema, ret
