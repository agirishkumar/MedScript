ht side, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision in the right eye, dizziness upon standing, and slight neck stiffness. These symptoms have been persistent over the past three days.

2. Possible Diagnoses
Primary Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

Differential Diagnoses:
- Migraine
- Tension-type Headache
- Temporal arteritis
- Cervicogenic headache
- Brain tumor or metastasis

3. Reasoning Process
The primary diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is supported by the sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. The localized pain on one side, along with blurred vision and neck stiffness, further supports this diagnosis. SAH can cause dizziness due to increased intracranial pressure. While migraine and tension-type headache could present with similar symptoms, the acute nature and severity of the presentation make SAH more likely. Temporal arteritis typically presents with a more gradual onset, and cervicogenic headache usually has a mechanical trigger. A brain tumor or metastasis would not typically present with such acute symptoms without prior warning signs.

4. Recommended Tests or Examinations
- Non-contrast CT scan of the head to rule out bleeding or mass effect
- Lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid for xanthochromia (yellow discoloration), which indicates blood in the CSF
- Blood tests to check for coagulation disorders or vasculitis
- Ophthalmologic evaluation to assess visual acuity and optic nerve function

5. Potential Treatment Options
If confirmed as SAH, immediate neurosurgical consultation will be necessary for possible surgical intervention. Management may include:
- Close monitoring in an intensive care unit
- Pain management with analgesics and antiemetics
- Control of hypertension if present
- Steroids to reduce inflammation and edema
- Anticonvulsants if seizures occur

6. Immediate Precautions or Recommendations
The patient should avoid any strenuous activity and remain supine with her head elevated to minimize dizziness. She should also avoid bright lights and loud noises to manage photophobia and phonophobia. Immediate transport to a facility capable of performing emergency neuroimaging is crucial.

7. Follow-up Plan
The patient should be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and further diagnostic workup. Neurosurgery should be consulted urgently. If SAH is confirmed, she will require ongoing neurological assessment and supportive care until stabilization. Follow-up appointments with both neurology and ophthalmology will be scheduled after discharge to ensure proper recovery and address any residual effects.

8. Summary
This 35-year-old female presents with severe right-sided headache, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, blurred vision, dizziness, and neck stiffness. Given the acute onset and severity of symptoms, subarachnoid hemorrhage is the most likely diagnosis. Immediate imaging studies and lumbar puncture are essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Urgent neurosurgical consultation is required, and the patient should be closely monitored in an ICU setting.
