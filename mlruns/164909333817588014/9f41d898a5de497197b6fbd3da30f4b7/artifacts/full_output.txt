Comprehensive Diagnostic Report

1. Initial Impression
The patient is a 35-year-old female presenting with severe headaches localized to the right side, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision in the right eye, dizziness upon quick standing, and slight neck stiffness. The patient has no significant past medical history and takes no current medications.

2. Possible Diagnoses
Primary Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

Differential Diagnoses:
- Migraine with aura
- Tension-type headache
- Temporal arteritis
- Cervicogenic headache
- Optic neuritis

3. Reasoning Process
SAH is considered as the primary diagnosis due to the sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and blurred vision, particularly in one eye. These symptoms suggest bleeding within the subarachnoid space, which can cause irritation of cranial nerves and blood vessel compression. The dizziness upon quick standing could be related to orthostatic hypotension secondary to blood loss or vasospasm. Neck stiffness may indicate meningeal irritation.
Migraine with aura could also present similarly but typically lacks focal neurological deficits like blurred vision and would not explain the dizziness upon standing. Tension-type headache and cervicogenic headache do not fit the acute presentation and symptom severity. Temporal arteritis would more commonly affect elderly patients (>50 years old) and often presents with jaw claudication and scalp tenderness. Optic neuritis usually presents with unilateral vision loss without associated headache.

4. Recommended Tests or Examinations
- CT scan without contrast to rule out SAH
- Lumbar puncture if CT scan is negative but clinical suspicion remains high
- Blood tests for complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile, and electrolytes to assess for any underlying conditions contributing to the hemorrhage
- Ophthalmologic examination to evaluate for papilledema or optic disc swelling
- Neurological examination focusing on cranial nerve function and gait stability

5. Potential Treatment Options
If SAH is confirmed, management will focus on stabilization, pain control, and prevention of rebleeding. This includes:
- Hospital admission for close monitoring and fluid resuscitation
- Pain management using analgesics and antiemetics
- Prevention of rebleeding through bed rest, avoidance of heavy lifting, and strict blood pressure control
- Consultation with neurosurgery for possible surgical intervention depending on the aneurysm size, location, and patient's condition

6. Immediate Precautions or Recommendations
The patient should avoid any strenuous activities, driving, or operating heavy machinery until further evaluation and treatment. Educate the patient on signs of worsening symptoms such as increased headache intensity, decreased level of consciousness, or new focal neurological deficits, which necessitate immediate medical attention.

7. Follow-up Plan
Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess symptoms and review imaging results. If SAH is confirmed, arrange for a consultation with neurosurgery within two weeks. Monitor vital signs closely and ensure compliance with medication adherence.

8. Summary
A 35-year-old female presents with severe right-sided headache, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision in the right eye, dizziness upon standing, and slight neck stiffness. Given the acute nature and severity of her symptoms, SAH is considered the primary diagnosis. Further diagnostic workup includes a CT scan and lumbar puncture if necessary. Management involves hospital admission for stabilization, pain control, and prevention of rebleeding. Close monitoring and follow-up with neurosurgery are essential. Educate the patient on recognizing worsening symptoms and adhering to bed rest and medication regimen.
