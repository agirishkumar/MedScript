t side, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision in the right eye, dizziness upon standing, and slight neck stiffness. These symptoms have developed over the past three days.

2. Possible Diagnoses
### Primary Diagnosis:
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

### Differential Diagnoses:
Migraine Headache with Aura, Temporal Arteritis, Meningitis, Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis

3. Reasoning Process
The primary diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is supported by the sudden onset of severe headache, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, and neck stiffness, which suggest increased intracranial pressure. The patient's age, gender, and lack of significant past medical history also favor this diagnosis. The presence of focal symptoms, specifically blurred vision in one eye, raises concern for a localized lesion rather than a more general condition such as migraine or meningitis. Temporal arteritis typically presents with gradual onset of symptoms and often involves multiple arteries; SAH has a more acute presentation. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis can present with similar symptoms but usually involves bilateral involvement.

4. Recommended Tests or Examinations
- Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the brain to evaluate for any vascular abnormalities.
- Lumbar Puncture (LP) to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for xanthochromia, indicative of blood products within the CSF, supporting the diagnosis of SAH.
- Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Coagulation Profile to rule out bleeding disorders that could contribute to SAH.
- Electrolyte panel and Renal Function Test to identify any electrolyte imbalances or renal dysfunction that may affect management decisions.

5. Potential Treatment Options
If confirmed as SAH, the treatment would involve close monitoring in an intensive care unit, stabilization, and surgical intervention if necessary. Management might include pain control, anti-emetics, and anticonvulsants to prevent seizures. For differential diagnoses like migraine or temporal arteritis, treatment options include appropriate medications to manage symptoms, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids respectively.

6. Immediate Precautions or Recommendations
Immediate precautions include maintaining bed rest with gradual increase in activity as tolerated. Avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting. Ensure hydration status is monitored closely due to risk of dehydration secondary to nausea and vomiting. Monitor vital signs frequently, particularly blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate, given the patient's symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure.

7. Follow-up Plan
Follow-up should occur within 24-48 hours after initial evaluation to reassess symptoms and review imaging results. If SAH is confirmed, further consultations with neurosurgery will be required. If another diagnosis is suspected, appropriate specialists will be consulted depending on the findings.

8. Summary
This patient presents with severe headache, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, and neck stiffness. Given the clinical presentation and exclusion of alternative diagnoses, the primary diagnosis is Subarachnoid Hemorrhage. The immediate plan includes ordering CTA and LP to confirm the diagnosis and initiating supportive care measures in the ICU. Further consultations with neurosurgery will be arranged as needed. The patient should avoid strenuous activities and maintain adequate hydration until further evaluation.
