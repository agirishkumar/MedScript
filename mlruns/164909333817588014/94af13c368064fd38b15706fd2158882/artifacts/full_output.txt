Comprehensive Diagnostic Report

1. Initial Impression:
The patient is a 35-year-old female presenting with severe headaches predominantly on the right side, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision in the right eye, dizziness upon quick standing, and slight neck stiffness.

2. Possible Diagnoses:
Primary Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

Differential Diagnoses:
A) Migraine
B) Cluster Headache
C) Temporal Arteritis
D) Cervicogenic Headache
E) Internal Carotid Aery Dissection

3. Reasoning Process:
SAH is considered as the primary diagnosis due to the sudden onset of severe headache, photophobia, phonophobia, and associated neurologic deficits such as blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and vertigo/dizziness. The patient's age group puts her at higher risk for SAH compared to migraine or cluster headaches. Although temporal arteritis could present similarly, there is no mention of jaw claudication or systemic signs of inflammation, making it less likely. Cervicogenic headache presents typically after neck trauma or strain, which is not reported here, making it a less likely choice. Internal carotid artery dissection could present similar symptoms but would require additional objective findings, such as Horner syndrome or decreased limb strength, to suggest arterial involvement.

4. Recommended Tests or Examinations:
A) Non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the head – This is the imaging modality of choice for initial evaluation of SAH due to high sensitivity (97%) in detecting acute blood in the subarachnoid space.
B) Lumbar Puncture (LP) - If CT scan negative but clinical suspicion remains high, an LP can be performed to detect xanthochromia, a yellowish discoloration of CSF due to oxidized hemoglobin from SAH.
C) Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA) - If there is any suspicion for arterial pathology, such as internal carotid artery dissection, this will serve as a more sensitive investigation than CT angiography.
D) Ophthalmologic Examination - To evaluate for pupillary inequality, visual field defects, and retinal hemorrhages that may help in diagnosing SAH and ruling out other conditions like cluster headache or optic neuritis.

5. Potential Treatment Options:
If confirmed SAH,
A) Anesthetic Management – Early intubation if GCS < 13 or rapid decline, or if large bleed identified on imaging.
B) Neurosurgical Consultation – For potential surgical intervention like clipping of the ruptured aneurysm.
C) Management of Raised Intracranial Pressure – Mannitol or hypertonic saline administration according to established guidelines.
D) Anti-Epileptic Drugs – Preventive medication may be prescribed depending on individual risk factors or presence of seizure activity.
E) Supportive Care – Monitor vital signs, hydration, and nutrition closely, and provide adequate pain management.

6. Immediate Precautions or Recommendations:
Urgent evaluation by a neurologist and neurosurgeon is necessary. Avoid anticoagulants until further evaluation has ruled out SAH. Ensure prompt treatment once diagnosed to minimize morbidity and mortality risks.

7. Follow-up Plan:
Monitor patient closely in an acute care setting or ICU, especially if large bleed found on imaging. Arrange regular follow-ups with neurology and possibly oncology if arteriovenous malformation suspected. Discuss lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding smoking and alcohol, and ensure compliance with prescribed therapies.

8. Summary:
This case report describes a potentially life-threatening condition (subarachnoid hemorrhage), necessitating immediate medical attention and close monitoring. The differential diagnoses listed highlight essential considerations given the presented symptoms. The recommended tests and examinations aim to confirm or rule out the primary diagnosis while providing alternative options for differential diagnoses. Effective triage, appropriate imaging studies, and expeditious consultations with specialists are crucial for optimal outcomes.
