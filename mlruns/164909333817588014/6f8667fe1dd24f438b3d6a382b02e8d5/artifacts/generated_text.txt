right side for three days, accompanied by photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision in the right eye, dizziness upon standing, and slight neck stiffness.

## 2. Possible Diagnoses
### Primary Diagnosis:
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

### Differential Diagnoses:
1. Migraine
2. Tension-type Headache
3. Meniere's Disease
4. Acoustic Neuroma

## 3. Reasoning Process
- Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH): The patient's sudden onset of severe unilateral headache, associated with nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and blurred vision suggests a possible SAH. Additionally, her symptoms include dizziness upon standing, which could be indicative of increased intracranial pressure.
  
- Migraine: Although migraine can cause similar headache features, the presence of blurred vision, dizziness, and neck stiffness make SAH more plausible than migraine as the primary diagnosis.
  
- Tension-type Headache: This type of headache typically does not present with the combination of photophobia, phonophobia, and visual disturbances seen in this case.
  
- Meniere's Disease: Characterized by vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and ear fullness, this diagnosis doesn't fit with the absence of auditory symptoms and the unilateral nature of her headache.
  
- Acoustic Neuroma: A slow-growing tumor that typically presents with gradual neurological deficits rather than sudden, severe symptoms such as those reported here.

## 4. Recommended Tests or Examinations
1. Non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the head to rule out acute bleeding within the brain parenchyma or ventricles.
2. Lumbar Puncture (LP) if CT scan is negative but clinical suspicion for SAH remains high.
3. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) if LP reveals xanthochromia (yellowish discoloration of cerebrospinal fluid), indicating blood in CSF, to evaluate the source of bleeding.
4. Electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess for any focal epileptiform activity that may suggest an underlying seizure disorder.

## 5. Potential Treatment Options
1. If diagnosed with SAH, immediate neurosurgical consultation for potential intervention depending on the location and extent of bleeding.
2. Management of increased intracranial pressure using hyperosmotic agents like mannitol or hypertonic saline.
3. Pain management with analgesics as needed.
4. Anti-emetics for control of nausea and vomiting.

## 6. Immediate Precautions or Recommendations
Urgent hospital admission for further evaluation and monitoring due to the risk of rebleeding and delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND). Avoid strenuous activities or bending.

## 7. Follow-up Plan
A multidisciplinary team consisting of neurology, neurosurgery, and radiology will manage the patient closely during her hospital stay. After discharge, regular follow-ups should occur with her primary care physician to monitor her condition and address any complications.

## 8. Summary
This patient presents with severe, localized headache, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, dizziness upon standing, and neck stiffness, leading to a strong suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Urgent imaging studies and lumbar puncture are indicated to confirm the diagnosis and identify the source of bleeding. Close collaboration between neurology, neurosurgery, and radiology is essential for optimal management. Immediate hospital admission is necessary, along with pain and antiemetic management, until the diagnosis is confirmed and appropriate treatment initiated.
