ophobia, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision in the right eye, dizziness upon standing, and slight neck stiffness. The patient has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications.

## 2. Possible Diagnoses

### Primary Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

Given the sudden onset of severe headache, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and neck stiffness, SAH is a strong consideration due to the presence of red flags indicating increased intracranial pressure and potential cerebral herniation.

### Differential Diagnoses:

- Migraine with aura: While migraine can present with unilateral headaches and visual disturbances, the severity and rapid progression suggest that another condition may be more likely.
- Temporal arteritis: Although this condition typically affects older adults, it can present with similar symptoms; however, SAH remains a higher priority given the acute presentation.
- Cervicogenic headache: This type of headache originates from cervical spine pathology but would not explain the visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, or photophobia.

## 3. Reasoning Process

The primary diagnosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, is supported by the patient's symptoms. The sudden onset, severe nature of the headache, associated nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, and neck stiffness strongly indicate an increase in intracranial pressure, which may be due to bleeding in the subarachnoid space. The differential diagnoses do not fully explain all of the reported symptoms, especially the visual disturbances and photophobia, making SAH the most plausible diagnosis.

## 4. Recommended Tests or Examinations

1. Non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast: To identify any blood within the cerebrospinal fluid spaces as well as rule out any structural lesions that could cause similar symptoms.
2. Lumbar puncture (LP): If CT does not reveal SAH, an LP will aid in identifying xanthochromia (yellow discoloration of cerebrospinal fluid), which is indicative of previous bleeding in the subarachnoid space.
3. Blood tests: Complete blood count, coagulation profile, and electrolyte panel to assess for underlying conditions contributing to bleeding risk.
4. Ophthalmologic examination: To evaluate for papilledema or retinal hemorrhages, both of which may indicate increased intracranial pressure.

## 5. Potential Treatment Options

1. Management of elevated intracranial pressure: Administer analgesics like acetaminophen for pain control and antiemetics like ondansetron for nausea and vomiting relief. Monitor vital signs closely to watch for further neurological deterioration.
2. Neurosurgical consultation: If SAH is confirmed, consult neurosurgery for potential surgical intervention if there is a ruptured aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.
3. Antihypertensive medication management: Control hypertension to prevent further bleeding if an aneurysm rupture is confirmed.

## 6. Immediate Precautions or Recommendations

1. Urgent transfer to a tertiary care center with neurosurgical capabilities.
2. Maintain close monitoring of vital signs, particularly blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate.
3. Ensure the patient remains supine with the head slightly elevated to manage headache and prevent further complications related to increased intracranial pressure.

## 7. Follow-up Plan

1. Review imaging results and discuss findings with the neurosurgical team.
2. Implement appropriate treatment based on imaging outcomes.
3. Arrange for continuous neurological monitoring and reassessment every few hours to detect any worsening of symptoms.

## 8. Summary

This patient presents with concerning symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given the urgency of her situation, immediate non-contrast CT scanning followed by lumbar puncture, if necessary, should be performed to confirm or refute the diagnosis. If SAH is confirmed, she will require urgent neurosurgical consultation and potentially surgical intervention. Close monitoring of vital signs, pain, and neurological status is crucial, along with careful management of blood pressure.
