the right side, sensitivity to light and sound, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision in the right eye, dizziness upon quick standing, and slight neck stiffness. The patient has no significant past medical history and takes no current medications.

### 2. Possible Diagnoses
#### Primary Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH)

The primary diagnosis under consideration is subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the sudden onset of severe headache, especially unilateral location, associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, and visual disturbances. SAH can cause a sudden increase in intracranial pressure, leading to the symptoms observed in this patient.

Differential Diagnoses:
1. Migraine with aura: Although migraine could present with similar symptoms, the sudden onset and severity of symptoms, along with visual disturbances and neck stiffness, make SAH more likely.
2. Temporal arteritis: Though this condition presents with headache, the age of presentation is younger than typical for temporal arteritis, and other symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and jaw claudication are absent.
3. Tension-type headache: This diagnosis is less likely given the severe nature of symptoms and the presence of other neurological signs like blurred vision and neck stiffness.

### 3. Reasoning Process

The patient's symptoms suggest an acute neurological event with a rapid onset, which supports a diagnosis of SAH over chronic conditions like tension-type headaches or temporal arteritis. The unilateral nature of symptoms raises concern for a localized pathology rather than a diffuse process like migraine.

### 4. Recommended Tests or Examinations

1. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast: To confirm or rule out blood in the subarachnoid space and evaluate for any mass effect or hydrocephalus.
2. Lumbar puncture: If CT scan is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, consider performing a lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid for xanthochromia (yellow discoloration), indicating blood in the CSF.
3. Electrolyte panel and renal function tests: Assess for any electrolyte imbalances or renal dysfunction secondary to dehydration from repeated vomiting.
4. Complete blood count: Evaluate for infection or inflammation that may contribute to symptoms.

### 5. Potential Treatment Options

If confirmed as SAH:
1. Intracranial pressure monitoring: Place an external ventricular drain (EVD) if necessary to manage increased ICP.
2. Neurosurgical consultation: Discuss surgical intervention options depending on the location and extent of bleeding.
3. Antihypertensive therapy: Initiate beta-blockers to control blood pressure and prevent rebleeding.
4. Pain management: Administer analgesics as needed while avoiding medications that may interfere with coagulation or raise blood pressure.
5. Supportive care: Monitor and correct electrolytes, fluids, and nutrition; ensure bedrest and avoid activities that could exacerbate symptoms.

### 6. Immediate Precautions or Recommendations

Immediate hospital admission for close monitoring and further evaluation. Avoid driving until cleared by healthcare providers. Inform family members about the seriousness of the condition and advise them to stay with the patient during hospitalization.

### 7. Follow-up Plan

Daily neurological assessments, repeat imaging studies as indicated, and regular updates to neurosurgery for ongoing management decisions. Schedule follow-up appointments after discharge to monitor recovery and manage any long-term complications.

### 8. Summary

A 35-year-old female presents with severe right-sided headache, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, dizziness upon standing, and neck stiffness. Given the sudden onset and nature of symptoms, subarachnoid hemorrhage is considered the primary diagnosis, with differential diagnoses including migraine and temporal arteritis being less likely. Immediate diagnostic testing includes non-contrast CT scan followed by lumbar puncture if necessary. Management would involve hospital admission for intracranial pressure monitoring, neurosurgical consultation, antihypertensive therapy, pain management, and supportive care. Family should be involved in decision-making and ensure they understand the gravity of the situation.
