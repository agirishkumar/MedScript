    " Medical Reasoning:\nThe patient's recent vertigo, nausea, incoordination, left-arm heaviness/numbness/pain, and radiating neck pain are concerning for a cerebrovascular event, possibly ischemic stroke. Although the non-contrast CT was negative for large territory infarction, cerebral or posterior fossa hemorrhage cannot be ruled out. The patient received intravenous thrombolytic therapy based on an initial NIHSS score of 5, suggesting moderate severity. She was subsequently transferred for close monitoring. This plan leans heavily on imaging additional data, results of monitoring, and serial neurological assessments & adjustments in her medications (such as changes in blood pressure or anticoagulation management) to manage her RA.\n   Medical Treatment:\nTUJAH.0, LMW H.therapy FARANIFAZalez 100 MG Tablet, Once Daily \nStrength 1x100 MG;Crestor 10 MG, Once Daily \nZ-VIA 44 MG, Once Daily \nas needed lexotanil for Rx anxiety Establishment   ACTHAR AUTO -INJECTOR 0.5 ;ACTHAR AUTO -INJECTOR 0.75 ;ACTHAR AUTO -INJECTOR 1.0;GRANIX 2 MG;GRANIX \n2 MG ; DESconto Card \nEXTRA pharmaceutical   met acid  1 MG/10 MG ; burgeoning Y \nThe above treatment information might no longer be applicable based on the new presenting signs and symptoms and the context of her transfer for post-tTP monitoring. A re-evaluation of her RA and cardiovascular risk factors is required.\n   Next Steps: Address acute stroke needs\n      1.     Stroke alert group to contact UH neurology for consultation on post-tPA monitoring and additional imaging as needed.\n      2.     Continue monitoring serial troponins given patient's headache, neck, and shoulder pain.\n      3.     Address Gastroenterology for apparent small bowel bacterial overgrowth as seen in previous visits.\n4.     Address mental health team re-depression.\n   Additional Information:\n          The above treatment details, medications, and medical reasoning might require adjustments based on findings of immediate post-tPA monitoring and ongoing assessments by a neurologist."
