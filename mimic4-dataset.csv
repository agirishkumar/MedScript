She was seen recently in the ED for evaluation of left greater than right lower extremity edema with lower extremity venous ultrasounds negative, without change in edema since since that visit. She denies associated fever, chills, sweats, PND, orthopnea, or positional component to pain. In the ED, initial vital signs were: 98.0 116 100/49 24 99% RA. Labs notable for leukocytosis to 17.9, hematocrit of 32, and lactate of 2.8. Urinalysis was positive, but with 19 epithelial cells. CTA was negative for central pulmonary embolus, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion, though did reveal innumerable pulmonary nodules, as well as enlarged liver with stable metastases. EKG was interpreted as sinus tachycardia and was overall consistent with prior. Ceftriaxone/azithromycin were initiated for possible pneumonia. Vital signs on transfer were as follows: 97.9 107 100/60 22 100% RA. On arrival to the floor, she reports that shortness of breath has improved and that she is chest pain free. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> Per OMR: # metastatic cancer of unknown primary # high grade SBO ___ s/p exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, and small bowel resection with enteroenterostomy # carcinoid # hyperlipidemia # vitamin B12 deficiency # cervical DJD # osteoarthritis s/p R lung resection in ___ at ___ s/p hysterectomy in ___ s/p R arm surgery <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> Per OMR: Mother - Died of pancreatic cancer at age ___.

As you know, you were admitted for shortness of breath, likely due to your underlying cancer, and there was no evidence of pneumonia or blood clot in the blood vessels of your lungs. Your shortness of breath resolved, but you were found to have weakness in your left thigh and abdominal pain. You declined imaging studies for further investigation of these findings. You underwent biopsy of your liver that revealed that the cancer known to affect your liver and lungs originated in your colon (large bowel). You were transferred to the oncology service, but unfortunately chemotherapy would do more harm for you than good. After a long discussion with you and your health care proxy, it was decided that you will go home to be with your family and loved ones. We will also set up hospice services for you so that they can help with any issues that arise while you are at home. ","Ms. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary, including lesions in the liver and lungs, who initially presented with shortness of breath, likely due to worsening intrapulmonary tumor burden, and later underwent percutaneous liver biopsy with pathology consistent with metastatic colon cancer, prompting transfer to the oncology service and eventually discharged home with hospice. Active Issues: (1) Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: CTA to exclude pulmonary embolus and right upper quadrant ultrasound on admission demonstrated progression of previously recognized metastatic cancer of unknown primary involving the liver and lungs, which had evaded diagnosis in the outpatient setting due to patient reluctance to engage with care. Percutaneous liver biopsy ultimately revealed primary colonic adenocarcinoma. Following discussion with her outpatient oncology providers, she was transferred to the inpatient oncology service for potential trial of FLOX. However, given the patient's very poor functional and nutritional status a goals of care discussion was held with the patient's HCP, ___ and it was decided to focus goals of care of comfort and symptom management and the patient was discharged home with home hospice. (2) Left thigh weakness/spinous tenderness: She was found to have focal left thigh weakness in association with diffuse spinous tenderness of unclear chronicity in the setting of preserved rectal tone without saddle anesthesia. She was noted to be incontinent of urine, but not feces. Given underlying malignancy, there was concern for bony metastases or cord involvement, with alternative consideration given to epidural abscess, prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin/cefepim ___ to ___. Despite frequent persuasive efforts, she declined multiple attempts at lumbosacral MRI, including with lorazepam premedication, citing claustrophobia. Neuro exam was monitored and remained stable. (3) Abdominal pain: She experienced intermittent abdominal pain and tenderness without peritoneal signs, concerning for obstruction in the setting of intraabdominal malignancy, particularly given episodes of emesis/hematemesis as below. While multiple KUBs were negative for obstruction, CT abdomen was planned to evaluate for alternative sources of intraabdominal pathology, but she declined on multiple occasions. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol as needed. (4) ? Hematemesis: She experienced a single episode of small volume emesis, reportedly approximately 100cc, streaked with blood and found to be guiac positive. Vital signs and hematocrit remained stable. IV pantoprazole was initiated for gastrointestinal prophylaxis, with subsequent discontinuation of PPI given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was true blood vs. red popsicle was eating at time. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of recurrent hematemesis; no prior EGDs were available in OMR. (5) Altered mental status: She was intermittently altered throughout admission, never oriented to more than person and place, with occasional difficulty following simple commands as compared to an uncertain baseline. Infectious work up, including blood and urine cultures and CTA on admission with subsequent CXRs, was unrevealing. Noncontrast head CT was negative for acute intracranial process. Brain MRI for definitive exclusion of metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobia/MRI aversion as above. ABG on ___ without signs of CO2 retention. History of opiates making patient sleepy per HCP as possible contributing factor and therefore these were discontinued. Hepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic lesions to liver and asterixis on exam. AMS could also be ___ to severe depression. Mental status monitored and remained stable and patient at baseline per HCP on discharge. (6) Shortness of breath: She presented with acute onset shortness of breath without frank hypoxia. CTA on admission was negative for pulmonary embolus, though (subsegmental clot could not be excluded definitively), pleural effusion, or focal infiltrate. EKG and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against acute coronary syndrome. Low voltages on EKG were consistent with prior, hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion. Shortness of breath resolved over the course of admission without dedicated treatment, with the exception of nebulizers and expectorants as needed. (7) Leukocytosis: White blood cell count was elevated and peaked at 20.6, consistent with recent baseline, likely reflecting underlying malignancy. As noted above, infectious work up including CTA, urine and blood cultures, and CXRs, was unrevealing. She remained afebrile, with the exception of isolated transient fever to 100, with stable vital signs. (8 )Liver function test abnormalities: AST remained elevated ___ to ___, alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s, and total bilirubin 2.1 to 2.6, likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy. Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis or obstructive process. The possibility of superimposed intraabdominal process, such as infection, could not be excluded in the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above, but she declined CT for further evaluation. (9) Elevated lactate: Lactate was found to be 2.7-3.8 throughout admission despite copious IV fluids, likely reflecting compromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant infiltration. (10) Sinus tachycardia: She remained persistently tachycardic 100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor PO intake, but incompletely responsive to copious IV fluids. Tachycardia has been present since at least ___. Despite concurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate, there was no clear infectious source, hence low suspicion for sepsis. Subsegmental pulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of admission CTA, but shortness of breath was short lived, and she was never hypoxic. Hematocrit remained stable without signs of active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as above. (11) Depression: She appeared depressed with flat affect and seeming anhedonia throughout admission, with underlying depression likely affecting motivation to seek diagnosis and treatment of known malignancy. She denied active suicidal ideation and frequently declined home sertraline, particularly prior to liver biopsy, believing that it was supposed to be held preprocedurally despite explanation to the contrary. She was seen by social work throughout admission. (12) Normocytic anemia: Hematocrit remained stable and consistent with recent baseline at 27 to 33 throughout admission, seemingly due to anemia of chronic disease on the basis of preadmission labs. Vital signs remained stable, with the exception of persistent tachycardia, without signs of active bleeding apart from isolated blood streaked emesis as above. (13) Coagulopathy: INR of 1.2 to 1.8 was felt to reflect synthetic dysfunction in the setting of hepatic infiltration of malignancy, as well as poor oral intake. There were no signs of active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as above. Transitional Issues: -Patient discharge home with home hospice ",2964,1509

You were found to have elevated blood pressure on admission in the setting of not taking all of your medications regularly. We obtained an echocargiogram of your heart which showed some strain on your heart possibly related to your elevated blood pressures. You will be contacted about an outpatient stress test. This will be completed within the next month. You will be prescribed several new medications as shown below. A visiting nurse ___ come to your home to help with managing your medications. You should dispose of all your home medications and only take the medications shown on this discharge paperwork. Medications: STOP Hydrochlorothiazide STOP Simvastatin STOP Clonidine STOP Atenolol due to low heart rate CHANGE 325mg to 81mg once daily START Lisinopril 20mg once daily START Lasix 40mg once daily START Pravastin 80mg once daily If you experience any chest pain, excessive shortness of breath, or any other symptoms concerning to you, please call or come into the emergency department for further evaluation. Thank you for allowing us at the ___ to participate in your care. ","___ woman with h/o hypertension, hypelipidemia, diabetes mellitus on insulin, cerebellar-medullary stroke in ___, stage ___ CKD followed by Dr ___ presenting with fatigue and DOE for a few weeks, markedly worse the morning of admission. The patient has known diastolic dysfunction. Of note, she has been noncompliant with her medications at home. On arrival to the floor, she required hydralazine 20 mg to bring down her BP. She has likely had elevated BPs at home for a while, which is contributing to her SOB, CHF exacerbation, and secondary demand myonecrosis (hypertensive urgency) with mildly elevated troponin. # CAD: Although she did not have a classic anginal presentation, patient has several risk factors for acute coronary syndrome. Her only symptom was SOB in the setting of elevated BPs attributed to medication noncompliance at home. Her troponin fell from 0.05 at admission to 0.01 at discharge in the setting of renal dysfunction, but there was not a clear rise and fall to suggest an acute infarction from plaque rupture and thrombosis. She was scheduled for an outpatient stress test to evaluate for evidence of ischemia from flow-limiting CAD. We decreased ASA to 81 mg from 325 mg daily to decrease the risk of bleeding. Her LDL was found to be 146. We wanted to change her from simvastatin to the more potent atorvastatin (and avoid issues with drug-drug interactions), but her insurance would not cover atorvastatin. She was therefore switched to pravastatin 80 mg at discharge. From a cardiac standpoint, we did not feel that Plavix was necessary for CAD, but her neurologist was contacted and wanted Plavix continued. We had to stop metoprolol due to HR in the ___ during admission even off metoprolol. # Pump: Last echo in ___ showed low normal LVEF. Her current presentation was consistent with CHF exacerbation with bilateral pleural effusions, dyspnea, and elevated NT-Pro-BNP. Her TTE showed mild-moderate mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgitation, LVEF 50-55%, and pulmonary hypertension. We changed her HCTZ to Lasix 40 mg PO at discharge. This medication can be uptitrated as needed. # Hypertension: The patient's nephrologist, Dr. ___, agreed with our proposed medication adjustments, but recommended staying away from clonidine. There has been a H/O medication non-adherence. Social work was involved in discharge planning, and ___ will be assisting the patient at home. We added lisinopril 20 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg daily and continued nifedipine 120 mg daily. Her atenolol was stopped due to her renal dysfunction, but her metoprolol had to be stopped due to bradycardia. She should continue on once a day medication dosing to help with compliance. # ? COPD: The patient may have a component of COPD as she was wheezing on admission and responded to albuterol. She was given a prescription for albuterol prn. Transitional Issues: - She will be scheduled for outpt stress stress test - She has follow-up appointments with Dr. ___ and Dr. ___ and both can work on uptitrating her BP meds as needed. - ___ will need to work with patient on medication compliance.

As you recall, you were admitted for shortness of breath. This was because one of your heart valves was weak, which caused fluid to build up in your lungs. Your heart valve was weak because there was a blockage in one of your heart arteries. You underwent a procedure, called cardiac catheterization, which opened up the blocked arteries. Your valve and heart are pumping much more efficiently now. We are glad you are feeling better. Please weigh yourself every morning, and call your MD if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs over 24 hours. ","___ female with ___, HTN, diabetes, CKD presented with increased dyspnea and non-productive cough without fevers or elevated white count, initially admitted to ___ with concern for pneumonia. However, was found to have ST-changes, enzyme leak, new wall motion abnormality consistent with a recent cardiac event and had no evidence of pneumonia (no fevers, wbc, lactate, normal vitals, CXR with likely one sided pulmonary edema from mitral regurgitation). She was seen by cardiology who transferred the patient to cardiology floor. # Acute systolic CHF exacerbation/mitral regurgitation: Likely secondary to ischemic valvular disease resulting in worsening mitral regurgitation. ECHO also with akinetic inferior wall segments, which also supports an ischemic event. Cardiac cath revealed 3 vessel disease. Patient was managed medically with lasix, lisinopril, and metoprolol. Cardiac surgery was consulted for possible CABG and mitral valve repair/replacement. However, given her multiple comorbidities, she is extremely high risk and surgery was deferred. Therefore, the decision was made to revascularize the patient with PCI to see if the patient would regain function of her mitral valve. Patient received a bare metal stent in the LCx and plain old balloon angioplasty in the diagonal artery. Repeat echo showed improvement of her mitral regurgitation. # NSTEMI/CAD: As evidenced by EKG changes and troponin leak. Patient was briefly started on a heparin drip prior to her first cardiac catheterization. As above, cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel disease. Patient was initially medically managed with aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. As the patient would be too high risk for CABG, patient returned to the cath lab and had a bare metal stent and POBA. She will require plavix for at least 1 month. # Hypertension: Patient remained normotensive. Continued nifedipine at half of her home dose. Continued on lisinopril. She was also started on metoprolol as above for CHF. # Diabetes: Continued home insulin regime. # CKD stage IV: Baseline Cr 2.5-2.8 per renal notes. Currently at baseline. # History of CVA: Continued home aspirin and clopidogrel. # GERD: Continued home ranitidine. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: * Will need follow up with a cardiologist. Patient will be scheduled to follow up with the first available CMED cardiologist. * Will need plavix for at least one month (day of bare metal stent placement = ___. * Atorvastatin dose increased to 80mg (per pharmacy, her insurance will cover. Her co-pay will be $10/month). * Consider titrating nifedipine dose back to 120mg if still hypertensive. * Please recheck Chem7 at next appointment to evaluate for ___ secondary to dye received during cardiac catheterization.

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 milligram/kilogram/min. She had no anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes. TECHNIQUE: ISOTOPE DATA: (___) 11.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Rest; (___) 29.6 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress; DRUG DATA: (Non-NM admin) Dipyridamole; IMAGING METHOD: Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. Tracer was injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. Following resting images and following intravenous infusion, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi was administered intravenously. Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection. Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT. This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. FINDINGS: The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast attenuation. Left ventricular cavity size is increased. Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium. Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 59% with an EDV of 117 ml. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Increased left ventricular cavity size with normal systolic function.

Upon presentation she had a new macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis labs were negative. She received two units of packed red cells with an appropriate rise in her Hgb to 9.0. Stool was guiac negative, with no reports of dark stool or blood in stool. Her hemoglobin remained stable at this level, there was no overt bleeding, and her stool was guiac negative. After transfusion the patient reported significant improvement in her shortness of breath and fatigue. Given her history of gastritis and diverticulosis, a GI bleed was believed responsible for her anemia. Patient should receive an EGD/colonoscopy as an outpatient. # Acute exacerbation of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: The patient was also found to be slightly volume overloaded, and was treated with 2x40mg IV Lasix, with good urine output and symptomatic improvement. Her pulmonary edema and peripheral edema resolved with diuresis.

Transvaginal exam was performed for better evaluation of the uterus and adnexa. The endometrial stripe measures 5 mm. The left ovary measures 3.5 x 1.6 x 1.8 cm. The right ovary measures 2.9 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm. There is a small echogenic focus within the right ovary measuring 5 x 4 x 4 mm, likely a small hemorrhagic cyst. Both ovaries demonstrate normal arterial and venous waveforms. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of ovarian torsion. 2. Small right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst. . CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ___: Scattered calcified granulomas in the lung bases are stable. There is no new focal pulmonary nodule, consolidation, or effusion. The cardiac apex is within normal limits. Complete evaluation of the intra-abdominal viscera is limited by the non-contrast technique. However, the liver appears homogeneous without focal lesion. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas appear within normal limits. The adrenal glands are symmetric without focal nodule. The kidneys appear homogeneous without focal lesion or hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta is non-aneurysmal throughout its visualized course. The second and third portions of the duodenum are equivocally thickened which may be due to underdistension. No small bowel obstruction is identified. The appendix is well visualized and is normal in appearance. There is no free fluid or free air. CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST ___: Initial images demonstrated a solid mass like abnormality in the cecal tip measuring approximately 3 cm (2: 51). As this was potentially concerning for a cecal mass, rescanning of a limited portion of pelvis was performed after passage of oral contrast, confirming the finding and demonstrating a 3 cm mass with thickening of the adjacent cecal wall (601: 15). The adjacent appendix is normal and there is no pericecal inflammatory change. The remainder of the colon is normal without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. The surgical anastomosis within the lower midline pelvis appears unremarkable. There is no pelvic free fluid. The uterus and adnexa appear within normal limits. The bladder is markedly distended but is otherwise unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are identified. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No bone destructive lesion or acute fracture is identified. IMPRESSION: 1. Findings consistent with a 3 cm cecal mass and thickening of the cecal tip concerning for neoplasm. Atypical infectious process causing this appearance is felt less likely due to lack of inflammatory stranding. Recommend colonoscopy for further evaluation. 2. Normal appendix, no signs of inflammation. 3. No small or large bowel obstruction. 4. Equivocal thickening of duodenum likely related to underdistention. Colonoscopy ___: Findings: Lumen: Evidence of a previous end to end ___ anastomosis was seen at the sigmoid colon. Protruding Lesions A ulcerated 3 cm mass of malignant appearance was found in the cecum. The scope traversed the lesion. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the cecum. Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula with small openings were seen in the descending colon. Impression: Mass in the cecum (biopsy) Diverticulosis of the descending colon Previous end to end ___ anastomosis of the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum . PATHOLOGY: DIAGNOSIS: ""Cecal mass"", mucosal biopsies: Colonic mucosa with focal ischemic change and abundant associated ulceration, exudate, and granulation tissue formation; no carcinoma or dysplasia in these samples.

Your ___ team ","BRIEF SUMMARY: ============== ___ year old women with a history of bladder cancer s/p cystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, whose post operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, ileus, and pelvic fluid collections w/ one LLQ drain presented with subjective fevers, lethargy, and bloody drain output. She was found to have worsening anemia and was given 2 units of pRBC with appropriate increase in hemoglobin noted. She was also found on CT imaging to have an interval increase in size of a left abdominal fluid collection. Decision was made to place a drain per ID. Fluid was sent and revealed: negative cultures, negative malignant cells, no evidence of lymphatic or urinary fluid. This new drain was subsequently removed per ___ as fluid collection was completely drained. The prior drain was still draining serosanguinous fluid and was kept in but repositioned. ID was consulted for the fevers, leukocytosis and fluid collections and was deemed to need antibiotics and tranisitioned from broad spectrum to IV ertapenem at discharge. Will require multiple follow ups and imaging as specified in the transitional issues. ACUTE ISSUES: ============= #Pelvic fluid collections: patient arrived with one anterior drain putting out serosanguinous fluid. CT abdomen/pelvis revealed enlarging left fluid collection, and decision was made to place a drain per ___. The fluid was negative for malignant cells. The fluid had Cr 1 and triglycerides <9 suggesting that fluid collection is neither urine nor lymphatic fluid. Fluid culture was negative for bacteria. On interval imaging, the new enlarging fluid collection had completely collapsed and the drain was removed. As for the other fluid collection that already had a drain putting out serosanguinous fluid, it continued to drain serosanguinous fluid but at a lower rate than prior to admission. The drain was left in place as the fluid collection on imaging had not completely collapsed. BID - N cultures for the aforementioned fluid collection came back positive for MSSA but per ID, does not reflect rue intra-abdominal infection. Given that patient had a fever at OSH and a leukocytosis, she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc, ceftaz and flagyl. This was tapered per ID team to IV zosyn. On discharge, ID recommended ertapenem for approximately 4 weeks with final length of treatment to be determined by fluid collection changes on repeat imaging on outpatient basis. Mrs. ___ remained afebrile, and leukocytosis resolved. #Pulmonary embolism: Likely developed in the setting of being diagnosed with a post-op DVT. She was placed on lovenox. She was transitioned to heparin ggt as she needed ___ procedures and was transitioned back to lovenox but at a lower dose per weight dosing to 70mg q12H upon discharge. #Acute renal injury: SCr has been steadily rising from a baseline of around 0.04-0.06 in ___ to 1.1, likely ___ obstructed uropathy ___ large pelbic fluid collections. ___ resolved over the course of her hospital stay with final Cr 0.8. #Hydronephrosis: bilateral and worsening on interval imaging from prior studies. Given patient's age, adequate urinary output, adequate creatinine clearance, and no significant electrolyte abnormalities, patient likely would not significantly benefit from intervention at this time. Per urology consult, deemed stable for discharge and recommended outpatient urology followup. #Anemia: likely a combination of anemia of chronic inflammation and acute blood loss ___ to anterior abdominal drain showing serosanguinous fluid. Labs not consistent with hemolysis. Received 2 units of pRBC with appropriate response. Patient was discharged with Hgb of 8.3 per hem/onc recommendation for threshold Hgb>8 as patient feels and functionally performs better with higher blood counts. #Hypokalemia: was hypokalemic and was repleted with oral KCl PRN. CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== #Invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma, involving the deep muscularis propria S/p cystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, whose post operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, ileus, and pelvic fluid collections. Patient stating that there is no plan for chemo and radiation, her PET scan does show concerning foci of metastatic disease in the lung and peritoneum. Per patient's son, Mrs. ___ has seen a doctor to work up the lung mass. Will need ongoing discussion with outpatient hem/onc regarding how to best manage concerning lesions. #Breast mass ___ mammogram showing BI-RADS 5, Solid mass in the 3 o'clock left breast with features of a highly suspicious for malignancy. Per patient's son, she has seen a doctor for evaluating the new breast mass. Would recommend ongoing discussion with aforementioned doctor and outpatient hem/onc about plan to manage. # HLD: continued atorvastatin without changes. Consider evaluation regarding stopping atorvastatin on outpatient basis # Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine without changes. #HCP: Dr. ___ (son, ___ physician) ___ #Code status: full code (confirmed with patient on ___ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== [ ] Will need infectious disease follow up.

CXR ___: No acute cardiopulmonary process 2. ___: Exercise stress test INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old woman with a history of PAD and LBBB was referred to the lab from the ER following negative serial cardiac markers for evaluation of chest discomfort. The patient was referred for a dipyridamole stress test but due to her theophylline therapy we were not able to proceed. Due to her frequent atrial ectopy we chose not to give her dobutamine but had her walk on the treadmill instead. She exercised for 3 minutes of a modified ___ protocol and stopped due to leg claudication. The estimated peak MET capacity was 2.5 which represents a poor functional capacity for her age. No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study. The ST segments are uninterpretable for ischemia in the setting of the baseline LBBB. The rhythm was sinus with frequent isolated apbs, occasional atrial couplets and a 6 beat run of PSVT. Rare isolated vpbs were also noted. Resting mild systolic hypertension with a pprorpriate increase in BP with exercise and recovery. IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or interpretable ST segments at a high cardiac demand and poor functional capacity. Nuclear report sent separately. 3. ___ CATH: LMCA: short, no CAD. LAD: mild focal origin disease (20%) and mild proximal disease (30%). LCX: minimal luminal irregularities. RCA: 30%. 4. ECG ___: sinus rhythm with multiple PACs, left axis deviation, old LBBB 5. ECG ___: Likely atrial tachycardia. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing atrial tachycardia has replaced sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Left bundle-branch block was previously noted. 6. ECHO ___: Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, frequent atrial ectopy is seen; biventricular function appears similar.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Ms. ___, You were admitted to ___ due to concerning chest pain symptoms which we think are due to infrequent bursts of a rapid heart rate. Since the rapid rate makes you at increased risk for stroke, you were started on a blood thinning medication called Rivaroxaban which you will need to take every day. Our specialized cardiologists who deal specifically with the electrical rhythm of the heart evaluated you and felt that you would benefit from a medication called amiodarone which was also started. You will need to follow up with them in their clinic regarding this abnormal rhythm. In the meantime, you were outfitted with a Holter monitor to record your heart rate at home. It is very important that you follow up with Dr. ___ your cardiologist. We wish you all the best, Sincerely, Your care team at ___ "," =========================================================== ___ PMH of CAD, PVD, and COPD presenting with recurrent non-exertional substernal chest pain. The patient has a history of mild CAD but labs were significant for negative troponins and EKG was without ischemic changes. During her admission, she also developed multiple episodes of atrial tachycardia (AFib vs. Aflutter) and was started on Amiodarone for rate/rhythm control and Rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, and kept on home dose of Diltiazem also for rate control. She did not have any episodes of chest pain during hospitalization, so was discharged once atrial fibrillation/flutter was controlled. She will need to follow up with her primary care doctor regarding vague chest pain which led to admission. Acute Issues: ======================================================== #Atrial Tachycardia: During admission pt had runs of wide complex tachyarrythmia, thought likely supraventricular in origin: rapid Atrial Fibrillation/ Flutter vs. atrial tachycardia, with abberancy (complexes with similar morphology to native LBBB). She was treated with Diltiazem and Amiodarone and had fewer episodes of tachycardia. EP team evaluated patient and recommended anticoagulation and outpatient follow up to consider EP study and possible ablation of Atrial Flutter. Patient was discharged with ___ of Hearts monitor, Amiodarone 200mg twice daily x 1 week followed by 200 mg daily thereafter. Diltiazem continued at home dose. Rivaroxaban added for anticoagulation. As per outpatient cardiologist (Dr. ___, plavix was discontinued in light of addition of Rivaroxaban and interest in avoiding triple therapy in this patient. Pt was given follow up appointments with Drs. ___. She was scheduled to see Dr. ___ EP evaluation in 2 months. #Chest pain: Pt presented with substernal chest pain that occurred at rest and was ruled out for MI with no troponin elevation or significant new ECG changes. Likely her chest pain was related to periods of tachycardia, although while in the hospital the runs of atrial tachycardia did not reproduce chest pain. She did not have any episodes of chest pain during hospitalization, so was discharged once atrial fibrillation/flutter was controlled. She will need to follow up with her primary care doctor regarding vague chest pain which led to admission. #Dry eyes: pt had erythema and pain of R eye, found to have dry eyes per optholmology. Sent out with Artificial tears and erythromycin eye drops. Patient had follow up appointment already scheduled with optholmology and was instructed to attend appointment. Chronic Issues: ============================================================= # COPD Pt appeared to be at baseline respiratory status. She was sent home with her home albuterol neb, albuterol inhaler, Fluticasone nasal spray, fluticasone-salmeterol diskus, tiotropium bromide nebs, and theophylline # PAD: As above, we stopped Clopidogrel as patient is now on Rivaroxaban and wanted to avoid triple therapy as per her cardiologist Dr. ___. Transitional Issues: ============================================================== 1. Patient was discharged on Amiodarone 200 mg po twice daily for one week until ___ and then 200mg po daily thereafter until her EP appointment with Dr. ___ in approximately 2 months. 2. Pt was discharged on Rivaroxaban 20 mg qpm with dinner 3. Pt discharged with outpatient ___ of Hearts monitor with results to be interpreted by Cardiologist. 4. She presented with chest pain but did not have elevated biomarkers or EKG changes concerning for myocardial damage. Moreover, pt remained asymptomatic during periods of supraventricular tachycardia while she was hospitalized. Patient may benefit from outpatient stress test if such symptoms return. 5. On day of discharge, pt had significant R eye pain and redness, was evaluated by Optholmology, who felt that it was just dry eyes, treated with erythromycin drops and artifiical tears. Patient already has appt w/ Opthamology in 5 days which she will need to attend. Full Code Contact: CONTACT: ___ (husband) ___ ___ (daughter) ___ ",3463,915

Your difficulty breathing was due to your COPD flaring. Your fast heart rate was due to your atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heart rate that can sometimes cause the heart to beat very quickly. Medications that you were taking, such as theophylline, were likely contributing. Your heart rate was lowered using the same medication that you take at home, diltiazem, given through your IV. Your COPD was likely worsened because of a cold. However, your flare was very serious requiring IV steroids and many inhaled treatments. You should follow up with the lung doctors as ___ as with pulmonary rehab to make sure your lung disease is being treated as well as possible to prevent you from coming into the hospital as often. Please call ___ to schedule an appointment with them. It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you all the best in the future. Sincerely, Your ___ team ","___ is a ___ with a history of CAD, PVD, and COPD and history of recurrent chest pain who presented with afib with RVR and COPD exacerbation. ACUTE PROBLEMS: #COPD exacerbation: Ms. ___ had had two recent ED visits for COPD exacerbation, most recently ___ when she was started on prednisone 60 mg. She presented to her PCP's office with worsening dyspnea despite this therapy and was also complaining of nasal congestion, suggesting a viral URI trigger. In clinic she was also noted to be in afib with RVR so was referred to the ED where she was admitted after control of her heart rate (see below). On admission to the floor, she was noted to have wheezing, increased work of breathing, and poor air movement. She was treated with 125 mg solumedrol and maintained on 60 mg PO prednisone daily. Her home theophylline was decreased from 400 mg BID to ___ mg BID due to concerns it was contributing to her tachyarrhythmia. She was placed on ipratropium nebs q6h, albuterol nebs q2h, and fluticasone-salmeterol. Pulmonary was consulted and recommended a trial of diuresis so she received 10 mg IV Lasix as well. Azithromycin was not given due to concerns for QT prolongation with theophylline and amiodarone (QTc was 460). She was started on a 5 day course of ceftriaxone instead, and discharged to finish the course with cefpodoxime. She was discharged with a prednisone taper (10 mg decrease q3d until at 10 mg, then stay at 10 mg until pulm follow up) as well as follow up with pulmonary rehab and a pulmonologist she previously followed with, Dr. ___. She was also discharged on 2L supplemental O2 to be worn at all times. #Atrial fibrillation: Ms. ___ has known atrial fibrillation for which she was on amiodarone and apixaban but was found to have HR in the 120s in her PCP's office, prompting her referral to the ED. Her COPD exacerbation was the likely precipitant, with medications also possibly contributing, particularly theophylline. She was started on a diltiazem gtt in the ED to control her rates than transitioned to diltiazem 90 mg q6h. After arrival to the floor, her rates remained controlled. Her amiodarone and apixaban were continued. Her theophylline was decreased to 200 mg BID from 400 mg BID. #Iron deficiency anemia. Patient was found to have microcytic anemia with low iron and ferritin. She was started on IV iron 125 mg ferric gluconate x4 doses and wasdischarged on PO iron with a bowel regimen. Her H/H was stable throughout the hospitalized; there was no evidence of bleeding. Transitional issues: - patient discharged on prednisone taper: decrease by 10 mg every 3 days until at 10 mg, then keep at 10 mg until seen by pulmonology - patient discharged with plan to follow up with pulmonology and pulmonary rehab. Can call ___ to schedule appointment with pulmonary rehab. - patient discharged on with 2 days of cefpodoxime to complete 5 day course of antibiotics for severe COPD exacerbation - patient discharged with O2 concentrator for continuous home O2 - patient's theophylline decreased from 300 mg BID to ___ mg BID due to her afib with RVR; may want to consider further theophylline wean, and addition of azithromycin (if QTc is decreased as patient also on amiodarone), and/or roflumilast therapy - patient found to be iron deficient, started on IV iron repletion, discharged on PO iron - patient found to have elevated TSH, please follow up free T4 which was pending on discharge - Code: full - Emergency Contact ___ (Husband) ___ Daughter ___: ___ ___ on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and concern that you were having a flare of your COPD. While in the hospital we increased your dose of steroids to help your breathing. You also received several nebulizer treatments that helped your breathing. You were also expressing some anxiety that may have been contributing to your shortness of breath. You were given a medication called Ativan for your anxiety that also seemed to help your breathing. During your admission you were seen by the pulmonary specialists. They recommended a CT scan that showed that you have extensive COPD but did not show any infection. They also suggested increasing the dose of your Advair inhaler, which we did. If you feel short of breath, first please check your oxygen level. If it is less than 90, you can use oxygen and your inhaler. If not, try to wait a few minutes, take a few deep breaths and see if your shortness of breath improves. You can use the medication called Ativan(lorazepam) to help with the shortness of breath(no more than three times a day). If still not improved, you can use one of the inhalers/oxygen. Please follow-up with all your appointments as listed below and continue to take all of your medications as prescribed. If you experience any of the danger signs listed you should call your doctor immediately or go to the Emergency Room. We wish you the best!

The Palliative Care team was consulted and started you on morphine liquid suspension to help with your breathing symptoms. Please take all your medications on time and follow up with your doctors as ___. Best regards, Your ___ team ","___ yo F with history of COPD on home O2, atrial fibrillation on apixaban, hypertension, CAD, hyperlipidemia, and recurrent hospitalization for COPD exacerbation over the last 4 months, who presented with dyspnea and increased wheezing secondary to severe COPD. #Recurrent COPD exacerbation: Patient presented with increased dyspnea and diffuse wheezing, likely secondary to COPD exacerbation. She has a history of multiple recurrent COPD hospitalizations. According to Pulmonary, patient has severe COPD based on her obstructive deficits on PFTs as well as her severe symptoms even at rest, as well as her more frequent exacerbations and is likely approaching end-stage disease. We continued Advair 500/50 BID, Spiriva, standing nebulizers, and theophylline. Pulmonary recommended additional budesonide inhalers to allow reduction of PO prednisone dose. Prednisone dose was increased back to 40mg (where patient was better) with a plan for slow wean by 5mg every 2 weeks. Also, patient was started on chronic azithromycin for chronic anti-inflammation; after discussion with Dr. ___ was agreed to stop azithromycin on discharge due to inability to monitor QT the week after discharge, with plan to restart azithromycin once Dr. ___ is able to see the patient. Patient did not want to go to pulmonary rehab. She was seen by Palliative Care who recommended initiation of morphine liquid suspension as needed for shortness of breath. # Acute kidney injury: Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 from a baseline of 1.0. She likely had poor PO intake. Creatinine on discharge was 0.9.

She was treated for her COPD with nebulizers and steroids, but continued to decline eventually suffering a PEA arrest thought due to hypoxemia requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. A temporary pacemaker was placed for periods of bradycardia that may also have contributed to her PEA arrest (versus being a manifestation of severe hypoxemia/severe hypercarbia preceding her arrest). She made a cognitive recovery but was unable to be successfully weaned from her ventilator. She had capacity and was able to make it understand that she did not wish: continued intubation & mechanical ventilation; re-intubation and mechanical ventilation once extubated; or, positive non-invasive pressure ventilation. After extensive discussions with her and her family, she was transitioned to DNR/DNI and comfort-oriented care. She was extubated to spend quality time with her family before passing from respiratory failure on the morning of ___ at 0515. Autopsy was declined by family. She was incidentally found to have a RUE DVT that was treated with heparin gtt (which was also used for anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation; she was temporarily transitioned to argatroban for concern of HIT, but PF4 antibodies returned at very low OD, making this diagnosis unlikely). She was also treated for an acute sinusitis with Augmentin during her hospital stay. ",2340,341

You were admitted to our hospital for gastric cancer. You had an attempted Robot-assisted laparoscopic partial gastrectomy and gastroscopy on ___ without complications. You tolerated the procedure well and are ambulating, stooling, tolerating a regular diet, and your pain is controlled by pain medications by mouth. You are now ready to be discharged to home. Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful recovery. ACTIVITY: - Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and feel you could respond in an emergency. - You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several times a day. - You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you see your surgeon at your next visit. - You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as tolerated. - Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common sense and go slowly at first. - No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. - You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you otherwise. HOW YOU MAY FEEL: - You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. - You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your throat during the surgery. YOUR BOWELS: - Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these medicines without a prescription. - If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving the bowels, call your surgeon. - After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon. PAIN MANAGEMENT: - You are being discharged with a prescription for **oxycodone for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly wean off these medications as tolerated. - Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. If you experience any of the following, please contact your surgeon: - sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours - chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness - cough, shortness of breath, wheezing - pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever - shaking chills, fever of more than 101 - a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain - nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or your medications - if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing) -any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you Additional: *- pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest or back *- urinary: burning or blood in your urine or the inability to urinate MEDICATIONS: - Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as you did before, unless you have been told differently. - If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to take, please call your surgeon. WOUND CARE: - dressing removal: - You may remove your dressings tomorrow ___ and shower that same day with any bandage strips that may be covering your wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off. Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery unless told otherwise by your surgical team. -Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage. Please call with any questions or concerns. Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care. We hope you have a quick return to your usual life and activities. Home with ___: You had a Foley catheter in your bladder placed by urology on the day of your surgery after difficulty trying to place it. You will keep the catheter until your appointment with Urology in 5 days (please call the number below to schedule your appointment), who will decide if you need it longer or attempt to remove it and see if you are able to void. Empty the bag as needed and as shown to you by nursing staff. You will be given a leg bag before your discharge, that you may use for short trips. This is a smaller bag that straps to your leg, to take home and wear if you are traveling outside your home. This holds a smaller amount than the bag you have now, so it needs to be emptied more often. Some people find it easier to use the larger bad when they are at home or carry it with them. -- Your ___ Care Team ","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old Male who presented on ___ for a planned minimally invasive and possibly open radical distal gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy for locally advanced gastric carcinoma after chemotherapy. After placement of the Right upper quadrant port, insufflation revealed the right upper quadrant port to be penetrating the omentum. It appeared to miss the transverse mesocolon as well as the colon itself. During the surgery, there were visually obvious peritoneal deposits on all peritoneal surfaces in all four quadrants, which demonstrated undetected carcinomatosis, poorly -differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the peritoneum. For this reason, the procedure was then aborted. Post-operatively the patient was taken to the PACU until stable and then transferred to the wards until stable to go home. #NEURO: The patient was alert and oriented throughout hospitalization; pain was initially managed with dilaudid PCA which he was not using and then transitioned to tramadol which he got only one dose. Pain was very well controlled. #CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. #PULMONARY: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization. #GI/GU/FEN: Before the procedure started, OR nurse was unable to pass Foley after attempt with standard and coude type. PA ___, with usual sterile technique, re-attempted foley placement after 10cc urojet application with ___ and ___ coude-type catheters but was also unable to get passed the prostate. Urology was consulted and they performed a flexible cystoscope demonstrating a normal urethra. Using a flexible guidewire, cystoscope was advanced into the bladder. The scope was withdrawn and a ___ council was advanced over the wire, passed the prostate and into the bladder. The patient was discharged with the Foley in place with instructions to follow-up with urology as outpatient in 5 to 7 days for a voiding trial. No antibiotics were administered. The patient was tolerating a regular diet prior to discharge. #ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection, of which there were none. #HEME: Patient received BID SQH for DVT prophylaxis, in addition to encouraging early ambulation and Venodyne compression devices. On POD1 the patient was restarted on his home enoxaparin before discharge. #TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -------------------- At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating diet as above per oral, ambulating, and pain was well controlled. The patient was discharged home with the Foley catheter with appropriate teaching for care. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan. ",2239,600

There is no left renal calculus. There is no evidence of ureteral or urinary bladder calculus. There is symmetric renal enhancement and excretion of intravenous contrast. Subcentimeter cortically based hypodensity in the left interpolar region (06: 30) is too small to accurately characterize but likely represents renal cyst. There is no evidence of collecting system filling defect. There are segments of the mid to distal ureters are not well opacified, possibly secondary to peristalsis, however there is no evidence of inflammatory change or mass about the ureters. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. Low hepatic attenuation on noncontrast imaging is consistent with hepatic steatosis. There is no evidence of focal hepatic mass. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There are numerous gallstones within the gallbladder without evidence of acute cholecystitis. The spleen is not enlarged. There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation or evidence of pancreatic mass. There are no dilated loops of bowel. There is no evidence of bowel wall thickening. There is no intraperitoneal free air or free fluid. There are no enlarged inguinal, iliac chain, retrocrural, or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Abdominal aorta has a normal course and caliber with moderate atherosclerotic calcification. There is atherosclerotic calcification of the superior mesenteric artery origin.

You were admitted with severe chest pain. You underwent a stress test that showed the pain is unlikely from a big blockage in the arteries that feed your heart. Your lab work also did not suggest injury to the heart. The pain you are experiencing is most likely musculoskeletal and should hopefully improve with supportive measures such as Tylenol (maximum 3 grams per day) and time. You will also be prescribed high dose aspirin (650mg). Please try this for two days and if there is improvement in your symptoms continue it for the week. If your symptoms worsen, you develop shortness of breath or any other concerning symptom, please let your doctor know right away. Again, it was our pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the very ___, Your ___ Cardiology Team ","This is a ___ with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin, CAD s/p MI, S/P multiple PCIs and CABG ___ (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1; also SVG-D1 known occluded ___ with chronic stable angina admitted with atypical, stabbing, focal chest pain. # Chest pain: Initially the patient was started on a heparin drip and other ACS protocol medications. Her home losartan and furosemide were held due to low blood pressures. Suspicion for cardiac etiology of chest pain was ultimately not high. She had an isolated ongoing ___ left-sided chest discomfort exacerbated by changes in position and with chest wall tenderness to light palpation. Despite prolonged chest pain, troponin-T and CK-MB negative x2 and EKGs mostly unchanged from prior. Given known H/O CAD, a vasodilator nuclear stress test was performed and was reassuring. Her discomfort did not change in intensity during the stress test drug infusion. In the presence of diffuse ST-T wave changes, no additional ECG changes were noted during the procedure. The hemodynamic response to the Persantine infusion was appropriate. Her perfusion study was normal with interval normalization of prior LCx territory perfusion defect. Given the stabbing quality and tenderness to palpation of the area of discomfort, her symptoms were most likely related to costochondritis or other musculoskeletal causes. She was started on aspirin 650 mg q6h with plans to trial for 2 days and continue through the week if symptoms improve. Chronic medical problems: # Diabetes mellitus: Continued levemir and was switched to a sliding scale of Humalog. # Hypertension: Losartan was held as above due to hypotension and once daily isosorbide mononitrate was switched temporarily to isosorbide dinitrate TID. # For her hyperlipidemia, COPD and GERD, her home regimens were continued. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient had low blood pressures initially (88-92 systolic). Would benefit from close monitoring and titration of blood pressure medications as an outpatient - She was hypokalemic (K 3.0) during admission (with ___ and furosemide already held). Please recheck CHEM-10 at ___ ___ visit on ___ to determine whether she might benefit from K supplementation - Cr elevated to 1.2 on discharge (up from most recent 1.1.1).

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL? You had a diabetic foot ulcer on your left toe that was very infected and had caused an infection in your bone. WHAT WAS DONE WHILE I WAS HERE? Your big left toe was removed because you had a bad bone infection. You were treated with antibiotics to fight the infection and will need to go home on IV antibiotics. WHAT DO I NEED TO DO WHEN I LEAVE? Please continue to take your medications as directed. You will go home with an antibiotic infusion pump and will have a visiting nurse come to your house to teach you how to use it. You will need to administer antibiotics through the pump every 4 hours. We changed your diabetic medication regimen, so please follow along as instructed below and keep close track of your sugars at home. Check your sugars 4 times a day and log the results. Bring the results in with you to your ___ appointment on ___ at 1: 00 pm so that they can adjust your medication regimen appropriately. Please follow-up with Dr. ___ team on ___ at 11: 00 am. Please follow up with Dr. ___ your antibiotic regimen on ___ at 10: 30 am. Please follow-up with Dr. ___ in ___ ___ on ___ at 1: 00 pm. Be well, Your ___ Care Team ","============= SUMMARY ============= ___ yo F with hx of DMII, HTN who presented with diabetic foot ulcer on her left hallux complicated by osteomyelitis. She underwent surgical debridement and partial tissue and bone removal on ___. However the infection persisted, and she underwent left hallux amputation on ___. She was started on IV nafcillin for MSSA infection with plan to continue home infusions of nafcillin until at least ___ ACTIVE ISSUES ============= #Osteomyelitis of left hallux: Due to diabetic ulcer of left hallux. Patient underwent partial left hallux amputation on ___ by podiatry. She was initially placed on IV Vancomycin, Flagyl, and cefepime. Initial surgical cultures came back positive for MSSA, so was changed to IV nafcillin. Patient continued to be afebrile, but her left foot continued to have erythema, edema, pain, and the ulcer was not healing well. There was concern for poor arterial blood flow and therefore underwent noninvasive arterial studies on bilateral lower extremities. The studies showed mild atherosclerotic disease in her left leg and foot, and severe atherosclerotic disease in her right leg and foot. Vascular surgery was consulted for potential intervention, but they felt that no further vascular intervention was warranted prior to podiatric surgery. The patient was brought back to the OR by podiatry on ___ for total left hallux amputation given lack of clinical improvement. Her ___ blood cell count continued to down trend. The pathology report showed clean margins. However, patient was continuing to have pain, and there was increased erythema and swelling around surgical site. An MRI of the left foot was done, which showed devitalization of the surgical flap, some edema, and a hyperintense focal spot at the site of the surgery. There were no signs of abscess or fluid collection. Podiatry team felt patient did not need any acute surgical intervention and will have close follow-up on ___. A PICC line was placed in the right arm ___ with tentative plan to complete a two-week course of IV nafcillin on ___. For the wound, podiatry recommends daily dressing changes to left foot surgical site: Betadine moistened gauze, 4x4 gauze, and kerlix. #Cough: During her stay the patient developed cough that was nonproductive. It was thought to be due to atelectasis after surgery, especially since her rales on exam would clear with coughing. A repeat chest x-ray was negative for any acute cardiopulmonary processes and on comparison to previous chest x-ray during this hospital stay there were no changes. Will restart home Lasix at discharge. #Hypertension: Patient's antihypertensives were held upon admission given that her blood pressures were low with systolic blood pressures in the ___ likely due to sepsis in the setting of her osteomyelitis from her diabetic foot ulcer. After her first debridement, patient's blood pressures increase to 160s-170s so we restarted her losartan and furosemide. However her blood pressure dipped back down again to the ___ systolic and her creatinine bumped up to 1.8 so we discontinued her losartan and furosemide. Her metoprolol was continued with holding parameters, and it was held when her systolic blood pressure was less than 110. Her ___ resolved, and she became hypertensive again, so we restarted her losartan while in the hospital and instructed the patient to restart her Lasix upon discharge from the hospital. #Acute Kidney Injury: Her baseline creatinine is 1.0. It bumped up to 1.8 in the setting of sepsis, restarting her losartan and furosemide, and hypotension. We gave her IV fluids and stopped her losartan and furosemide. Her creatinine continued to improve with these measures and upon discharge it was 1.1-1.2, which is around her baseline. CHRONIC ISSUES ============== #Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Upon admission, patient was started on 80% of home insulin doses. Her Lantus inpatient dose was 32 units, and her Humalog inpatient dose was 12 units 3 times daily. Patient's blood sugars were hard to control while she was inpatient. Working with the ___ diabetes consult team we adjusted her insulin doses as needed. ___ recommended discharging the patient on 48 units of Toujeo and 18 units of Novolog with meals as well as resuming her Trajenta and Jardiance. #CODE STATUS: Full (presumed) #CONTACT: ___ (grandson's girlfriend) ___ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Patient is on oxycodone 5 mg Q8H for her foot pain from the surgery. She was given enough to get her to her PCP appointment, which is ___. Please re-assess pain management. [ ] Osteomyelitis, infected diabetic foot ulcer: Surgical margin from total left hallux amputation on ___ was negative for osteomyelitis. Patient to complete a 2 week course of nafcillin for ongoing soft tissue infection and will follow up with ID prior to completion of antibiotics to ensure resolution. Will be discharged on q4 hour nafcillin to be infused via a pump. Once finished an antibiotic should also have right arm PICC line removed. For the wound, podiatry recommends daily dressing changes to left foot surgical site: Betadine moistened gauze, 4x4 gauze, and kerlix [ ] Diabetes mellitus type 2: Patient's blood sugars were very labile. Given that she came in with a diabetic foot ulcer suggesting that her blood sugars are not well-controlled at home, she needs close follow-up to optimize her diabetic medication regimen. She is being discharged on reduced dose Toujeo and regular home Novolog along with her usual Trajenta and Jardiance with close follow-up with ___ provider on ___, ___ at 1 ___. Please reassess patient's need for Jardiance given history of recurrent AKIs [ ] Cough: Patient developed non-productive cough while in hospital but afebrile, no leukocytosis, CXR no signs of pleural effusion or consolidation. Suspect due to atelectasis in post-op period after foot surgery. Will discharge on incentive spirometer and restarting home Lasix as outpatient. If not improved once back on outpatient Lasix, would consider further workup. [ ] Hypertension: Patient was discharged on her regular home medications. While she was an inpatient, she became hypotensive when we restarted her on all of her antihypertensives. Please follow her blood pressure to ensure that she is on the right regimen. If too low, might consider removing furosemide. [ ] ___: Discharge creatinine 1.2 on ___. Suspect patient will have a slight bump in creatinine after restarting losartan on ___. Patient had weekly labs checked with IV antibiotic infusions. If continues to rise, may be due to nafcillin and would consider switching antibiotic to cefazolin. #CODE STATUS: Full (presumed) #CONTACT: ___ (grandson's girlfriend) ___ >30 minutes spent on complex discharge ",4440,1535

You were hospitalized with chest pain and had a nuclear stress test that was abnormal. You subsequently had a cardiac catheterization and you were found to have a blockage in the left circumflex coronary artery (one of the heart vessels). Take all medication as instructed. Please note the following medication changes: 1. Stop taking your potassium supplement for now, as your potassium levels were normal in the hospital. 2. Increase your atorvastatin (lipitor) dose from 40mg to 80mg daily. 3. Stop your lisinopril and lasix (furosemide) until otherwise instructed by your primary care physician. You will need repeat bloodwork on ___, which should be sent to your primary care physician, ___. Keep all hospital follow-up appointments. Your up-coming appointments are listed below. ","# Unstable angina: Description of the pain was somewhat atypical for angina in that she experiences in when she lays down and it is also reproducible. However, given her history of CAD status post multiple PCIs and many risk factors, the patient underwent stress test to rule out CAD. Nuclear stress test showed a reversible, medium sized, moderate severity perfusion defect involving the left circumflex territory. In light of these stress test findings, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization. Prior to cardiac catheterization, she was prehydrated given her acute kidney injury. The patient had a drug-eluting stent placed to the obtuse marginal branch. The patient became acutely hypertensive during cardiac catheterization and was started on a nitroglycerin drip (see discussion below). The patient was weaned from this quickly. The patient was continued on aspirin (full-dose), plavix, metoprolol, and imdur. Her home dose of atorvastatin was increased given evidence of coronary artery disease. Serial cardiac enzymes were negative times 3. OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Patient is to continue taking aspirin 325mg and plavix 75mg daily for the next year. Patient will have cardiology follow-up as an outpatient with the ___ ___ ___ group in ___. . # Acute kidney injury: Creatinine currently 1.7, up from 1.4 in ___. Renal function previously was normal. Upon admission, the patient's lisinopril and furosemide were discontinued. Of note, hte patient was started on furosemide approximately ___ months ago, which coincides with the development of the patient's elevated serum creatinine. Serum creatinine was trended through the admission and improved. The patient was restarted on her home lisinopril, though her serum creatinine was noticed to be increasing so was discontinued with instructions to restart this medication after follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was instructed to have a basic metabolic panel drawn ___. . # Diastolic heart failure: Patient was euvolemic through her admission. Her home lasix was discontinued during this admission given her acute kidney injury. The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician regarding ___ of lasix. OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Outpatient BMP for monitoring of serum creatinine and reinitiation of lasix by the primary care physician. . # Type 2 Diabetes Melltius, insulin dependent: Moderately controlled with last A1c 7.9% in ___. Lantus and sliding scale was continued through the hospitalization. She was discharged home on her home doses of lantus and her home insulin sliding scale. . # Hypertension: Through most of the patient's admission, her blood pressure was well controlled (goal <130/80). She was continued on metoprolol and imdur, though furosemide and lisinopril were discontinued in light of the patient's elevated serum creatinine. However, during the patient's cardiac catheterization, she was noted to have elevated systolic blood pressures and was started on a nitroglycerin drip for control of blood pressures. The patient was weaned from the nitroglycerin drip with in 4 hours after cardiac catheterization. The patient received a dose of lisinopril, but because of rising serum creatinine, the patient's next dose was held. OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Follow-up with primary care physician regarding recent hospitalization and anti-hypertensive regimen in light of elevated serum creatinine. . # Hyperlipidemia: Well controlled with last LDL 50 in ___ (goal LDL<70), though triglycerides mildly elevated. Atorvastatin was increased to 80mg daily given the new CAD lesions. Patient also had a fasting lipid panel that was drawn, which was pending at time of discharge. OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Follow-up of pending fasting lipid panel. . # COPD: Currently asymptomatic. Patient was continue fluticasone and albuterol as needed. ",2794,839

You were admitted with chest pain/pressure concerning for a heart attack. A cardiac catheterization showed that one of your grafts from your recent cardiac bypass surgery is clotted and no longer working, potentially causing your symptoms. We have increased and added medications to control your symptoms. The changes are below: START losartan START isosorbide mononitrate INCREASE atorvastatin INCREASE metoprolol DECREASE aspirin DECREASE pantoprazole STOP ibuprofen (you were taking too much. take tylenol ___ for pain) Once you leave the hospital, we recommend further workup of a fluid collection seen around your left lung and better management of your diabetes with the help of your PCP. ","___ year old female with a history of CAD s/p PCI x3, s/p CABG x3 (___), type 2 DM on insulin, HTN, and HLD who presented with a 3 day history of left sided chest pain and SOB. # Chest Pain- Patient with significant CAD history, s/p recent CABG, presenting with chest pain and rising troponins, with new ST depressions inferiorly in V4-V6, consistent with NSTEMI. Patient's troponins plateaued at 0.13. She has initiated on a heparin gtt in the ED, and was taken to cardiac cath the following morning. Catheterization showed occlusion of the SVG to the diagonal, possibly causing her current symptoms. No intervention was performed. Patient was medically optimized with increased metoprolol, initiation of losartan, and initiation of imdur. Other potential causes of her chest pain were considered including PE (ruled out with negative CTA), pericarditis (symptoms consistent, but exam and EKG not consistent, also patient has been essentially treated as she has been taking consistent NSAIDs), costochondritis (symptoms intermittently reproducible on exam), or pleuritis secondary to pleural effusion (very small effusion, stable since CABG). If pain persists, patient was instructed to speak with her cardiologist about increasing imdur should her blood pressure tolerate. # Acute renal insufficiency- On admission, creatinine elevated to 1.2, likely due to dehydration, as creatinine improved overnight with gentle fluids and remained stable. # COPD- Continued on home inhalers (albuterol, fluticasone) # DM- Continued with glargine 50 units Q6 and ISS # HLD- Continued on home atorvastatin # GERD- Continued on home pantoprazole # Transitional issues- - NEW MEDICATIONS- losartan and imdur - MEDICATION CHANGES- metoprolol increased to 50mg po TID (from 25 TID) - if ongoing chest pain, consider titrating up on imdur if c/w anginal pain. Also may consider treating for costochondritis and pericarditis ",2828,462

The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There continues to be progression of disease with increased extent of consolidative opacity within the right lung base. Ill-defined opacities within the lingula and left lower lobe are similar to prior. Small right pleural effusion is present. There is no pneumothorax. There is hyperinflation of the lungs. IMPRESSION: Evidence of disease progression. . CT Head: ___ FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or recent infarction. An area of encephalomalacia in the left frontal lobe, compatible with chronic infarct is unchanged. Prominence of the ventricles and sulci reflects generalized atrophy, notably in the bifrontal extraaxial spaces. Areas of periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity likely reflect sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. No concerning osseous lesion is seen. There are calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons. The visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process or mass effect .

Interval worsening of diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities, bronchiolar nodules and dense consolidation within the lingula and right middle lobe. After review of multiple recent prior chest x-rays and CTs, these findings can all be explained by worsening bronchioalveolar carcinoma, given the absence of any change rapid enough to suggest pneumonia. Of course pneumonia might be present and unrecognized, and treatment should be made on the basis of clinical findings. 2. Stable mild cardiomegaly. 3. Moderate emphysema. 4.

You had a cardiac catheterization and had a bare metal stent placed. After this, you had some trouble breathing and had a scan that showed some nodules in your lungs. A sputum sample was sent and malignant cells were seen. This was thought to be broncheoalveolar lung cancer, and you were treated with one dose of chemotherapy for this. Please follow-up with Dr. ___ to determine if further treatment will be needed. Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. The following changes were made to your medications: 1. You were started on plavix, a medication to thin your blood. You must take this medication for 1 month to ensure that your heart stent does not become blocked. ","___ is a ___ yo female with a history of CAD who presented with an STEMI s/p catheterization and was incidentally found to have multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with adenocarcinoma. #. STEMI: Pt presented with an anterior STEMI. Her TIMI risk score was 7 indicating a 41% risk at 14 days of mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Her SVG found to be completely occluded and a BMS was placed in the proximal LAD. Due to the timing of the SVG placement over ___ years ago, it was thought that her LAD had managed to self revascularize and was partially supplied by the RCA. She was started on routine ACS medications: eptifibatide for 18 hrs, plavix 75 and aspirin 325mg, metoprolol, captopril, and atorvastatin. Cardiac enzymes trended down appropriately with peak Ck and CKMB at 107 and 18.2. There was concern for acute heart failure from ischemic insult oxygen requirement. However, she was noted to also have a RLL pneumonia and no significant pulmonary edema (see below). ECHO showed moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior and anterospetal akinesis and inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. Initially, patient was started on coumadin for ventricular thrombus prophylaxis, but this was subsequantly discontinued as risk of bleeding outweighed benefit. # Hypoxia: Upon hospitalization, patient was maintaing saturations in low ___ on 6L from baseline 92% on RA. CXR showed RLL pneumonia, and patient was subsequantly started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, metronidazole. As the patient had history recurrent RLL pneumonia, a CT scan was obtained which showed severe right lower lobe consolidation and extensive, new diffuse lung nodules with sputum cytology positive for adenocarcinoma. Hypoxia was initially felt to be a combination of postobstructive pneumonia and tumor burden from adenocarcinoma. Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl of which she completed a 10 day course. Repeat CT scan showed little interval improvement in right lower lobe infiltrate. Respiratory status remained tenuous, patient requiring high flow O2 with 6LNC with desaturations to high ___ with activity. Prior to discharge O2 requirement was 5L by nasal cannula. She was breathing comfortably with oxygen saturation in the low ___. Likely this will continue to be necessary for some time. A shovel mask may be used to assist with oxygenation as needed. # Lung nodules/ Broncheoalveolar carcinoma: CT scan with diffuse pulmonary nodules and sputum cytology positive for adenocarcinoma. Etiology was felt to be primary bronchioalveolar vs metastatic thyroid dx (prior dx of possible microfollicular carcinoma) although routine cancer screening was not up-to-date. A tissue diagnosis was not attained given the patient's high oxygen requirement and anticoagulation with plavix/asa in the setting of recent ___ placement. Although patient did not have imaging of her head, staging based on CT torso was IIIa with pulmonary nodules in both lung fields without obvious distal LAD or metastasis. Empiric therapy with single agent chemotherapy was initiated on ___ with Pemetrexed. She tolerated this well. She received dexamethasone on ___ to prevent rash. # Chronic renal insufficiency - Patient with GFR 48. Medications were renally dosed and renal function was carefully followed. She was treated prophylactically with mucomyst prior to and post IV contrast dose. Creatinine remained stable at ___. # Hyperkalemia: The patient was mildly hyperkalemic the day prior to discharge to 5.6 without EKG changes. This responded promptly to kayexalate. Electrolytes should be checked daily until stable. If necessary ACEI could be stopped. # HTN: She was normotensive on ACEI and b-blocker. ",1442,876

In the hospital, we gave you a steroid injection near your right thigh for a condition called, Trochanteric Bursitis. We also gave you a medication called Gabapentin to help with your leg pain lower down. We also started you on a medication called Lovenox in order to bridge you back to your warfarin - currently, your warfarin dose is 7.5 mg daily and your INR was 1.9 at discharge (goal ___. Finally, you received 1 dose of intravenous iron because you are iron deficient which may be why you are more fatigued than usual. When you go home, please take your medications as prescribed and make an appointment with your primary care doctor. We do not know what exactly is causing the lower leg pain, so you may want to talk to your doctor about having an MRI of your spine.

Sincerely, The team at ___ ","SUMMARY: ================== Ms. ___ is a ___ with a PMH significant for antiphospholipid syndrome with DVTs and PEs on Coumadin, recent L-sided breast cancer s/p lumpectomy, who presented to the ED with acute on chronic right lower extremity and right hip pain, making it difficult to ambulate. Right lower extremity U/S and CT did not reveal a DVT though calf veins were not well visualized. ACTIVE ISSUES: ================== # Right trochanteric bursitis # Right anterior lower leg pain # Right sided varicose veins Pt endorsed >4mths of pain in RLE that became acutely worse over the last few wks. Her initial exam was most consistent with severe trochanteric bursitis on the right. She also has some focal pain along the right tibia which she felt was most consistent with pain from her varicose veins. The XRs of her tibia/fibula and right hip were without obvious pathology. There are no concerning neurologic symptoms to suggest a radiculopathy, no weakness or numbness though she may have some degree of chronic sciatica. Mildly decreased patellar reflex on the right as compared to left may have been in the setting of pain and guarding; strength was normal bilaterally as was her sensation. She underwent U/S guided steroid injection of her trochanteric bursa w/ significant improvement in symptoms; ___ stated that there was some fluid near the bursa, suggestive of acute on chronic trochanteric bursitis. Her anterior shin pain improved with initiation of gabapentin and lidocaine patch in addition to her home tylenol and an increase in the frequency of her home tramadol (q8h PRN to q4h PRN). Pt was not given her home hydromorphone PRN, though she did require one dose of 0.5 mg IV hydromorphone following her injection in the setting of an acute pain episode. She was discharged with Tramadol 50mg x15 tablets given increased requirement. By discharge, she was able ambulate and was felt safe for discharge home with a cane per ___ evaluation. Pt was eager to leave and will reach out to her vascular surgeon for an appointment early in the new year for treatment of her painful varicose veins. # Iron deficiency anemia: Anemia is new since ___. Normocytic. Downtrended overnight to 8.9 from 10.8. No concern for active bleeding. Per iron studies, she is iron deficient with a ferritin of 50. She endorses fatigue and restless leg syndrome. Etiology is unclear, though it may be related to the recent left breast hematoma of her breast (unlikely though the timing fits). Prior EGD with gastritis (___) for which she is on a BID PPI; prior colonoscopy ___ with findings that may be suggestive of celiac disease, though ttg at that time was normal with a normal IgA. She also had two polyps biopsied and were normal. On this admission, a vitamin D level was obtained to assess for evidence of malabsorption iso daily supplementation: level was 45. She was given ferric gluconate IV x1 on ___. TTG was repeated and pending at discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES: =================== # History of DVT/PE on warfarin: # Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: # Subtherapeutic INR: Lupus anticoagulant positive in ___. She has been taking her home dose of warfarin (5 mg ___ and 7.5 mg other days). Her warfarin was held last ___ iso hematoma and she was not bridged with Lovenox upon reinitiation. INR on this admission was subtherapeutic at 1.4. Bridged during this hospitalization with Lovenox for goal INR ___. She was given an increased dose of warfarin, 7.5 mg daily while in house. INR at discharge was 1.9, with plan to continue home warfarin regimen. Patient will get repeat INR on ___. # Vitamin D deficiency: pt takes 2,000 U vitamin D daily. Repeat level IS 45 which suggests against malabsorption to account for her iron deficiency. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== Code status: Full, presumed HCP: ___, granddaughter - ___. - Right trochanteric bursitis: [] Consider repeat injection [] Consider physical therapy - Right anterior leg pain [] discharged on gabapentin 600 mg three times daily [] discharged with tramadol 50mg, home regimen is Q8hrs and required Q4hrs during hospitalization. Will give two day supply of increased dose. Plan to see PCP next week. [] Consider outpatient MRI of the lumbar spine for chronic pain [] Consider EMG [] Vascular surgery follow up as outpt for treatment of painful veins - Iron deficiency anemia: [] Consider repeat IV iron infusion [] F/u pending TTG [] Consider further work up (though may be related to left breast hematoma) - History of DVT/PE, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, subtherapeutic INR: [] F/u ___ clinic on ___. Patient can continue home Warfarin regimen ",3628,1105

With this news, you were discharged home with PCP and cardiology follow up. Please continue to take your torsemide in order to maintain your weight. Please weight yourself everyday and call your cardiologist if you weight changes by three pounds. You also have ""pulmonary hypertension,"" which may be due to your underlying lung disease. Amiodarone can also cause lung changes and we recommend following up with the lung doctors as ___ outpatient to see if this may be contributing. It was a pleasure taking care of you! Your ___ team ","Mr. ___ is an ___ year old gentleman with history of CAD (s/p CABG and PCI), pAF, PAH, diastolic CHF who presents with weight gain, leg swelling and new evidence of right ventricle dilation concerning for acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation. #Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Exacerbation: with component of RV failure by report of OSH echo. Likely primary process is lung disease causing elevated RV pressures and subsequent poor filling of LV. He diuresed quite well with 20 IV Lasix which is consistent with RV failure. Started on torsemide 10 daily but this is likely too aggressive. We obtained an echo but read PND at time of discharge. We sent him home on a diuretic regimen on torsemide 5 mg daily (and discontinued home triamterene-HCTZ). Close follow up with Dr. ___ ensured. #Elevated Transaminases: Patient with mildly elevated AST and ALT. Most likely etiologies in this patient include amiodarone toxicity and congestive hepatopathy.

In addition, he does not follow a restricted fluid intake and drinks ___ glasses of water or juice daily. Furthermore, he has not tolerated guideline directed medical therapy due to recurrent issues with acute kidney injury and elevated transaminitis while on pembrolizumab therapy. He was clinically volume overloaded with elevated BNP 16020. We initiated IV lasix 160 bolus and put him on a lasix gtt with good response, however he his Cr increased from 2.1-->2.7. His Cr. improved with transition to PO Torsemide 40 mg daily. We monitored and aggressively repleted his potassium. No afterload reduction or neural hormonal blockade was added. # Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline 2.1-2.3 . Cr 2.1 on admission(Stable )- Cr on discharge:2.2 Cr initially uptrended above baseline from 2.1---> 2.7. Felt likely due to increased diuretic usage as it improved with stopping diuretics. Less likely cardiorenal syndrome. In addition,patient was recently seen in follow-up by nephrology. They felt his CKD was less likely to be related to pembrolizumab and more likely related to age-related decline in renal function. Creatinine 2.2 on discharge (stable). # Metastatic Melanoma He is followed by Dr. ___. He was previously on Pembrolizumab which was held due diarrhea, elevated LFTs and worsening kidney function. Negative troponin and CK MB, no concern for drug-induced myocarditis at this point. Followup in ___ clinic in 2weeks after discharge # Elevated transaminiatis Stable. Statin and ___ had previously been held. No changes made during admission. # Urinary frequency Likely due to diuretic use.

DISCHARGE WT: 116.18 lbs DISCHARTE Cr: 2.0 DISCHARGE DIURETIC: torsemide 60 mg PO BID SUMMARY: =============== Mr. ___ is a ___ man with PMH of HFrEF (35% ___, CAD s/p 3v CABG (___) and subsequent PCI to the LAD (___), moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on apixaban, stage III chronic kidney disease (Baseline Cr 2.0-2.1), cerebrovascular disease, and metastatic melanoma of unknown primary on Pembrolizumab (on hold since ___ iso worsening transaminitis and concern for cardiotoxicity). He was admitted with volume overload from heart failure exacerbation and pneumonia with high oxygen requirements. He initially required CCU admission for high flow oxygen, weaned to nasal cannula after aggressive IV diuresis and treatment of pneumonia with 5 day course of Zosyn after receiving vancomycin at OSH. He was transferred to cardiology floor where he continued to diurese well and his oxygen requirement was weaned to ___. He was transitioned to 60 mg torsemide PO BID which adequately maintained euvolemia. ACUTE ISSUES: ============= # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation Patient with history of heart failure with etiology likely ischemic cardiomyopathy given history of CAD s/p CABG and PCI. Admitted with fluid overload and pleural effusion. Trigger for current exacerbation could be infectious given evidence of pneumonia in left lower lobe on admission. Patient with high oxygen requirements prior to admission but responded appropriately to diuresis with Lasix. After IV diuresis, patient was transitioned PO torsemide and maintained at euvolemia. With effective diuresis, the patient's oxygen requirement gradually lowered from 4L NC to ___ NC. He was discharged on torsemide 60 mg PO BID. He was unable to tolerate afterload reducing agents or neurohormonal blockade agents due to hypotension. # Lower left lobe pneumonia Patient with evidence of pneumonia in the left lower lobe, received vanc/zosyn at outside hospital and continued on Zosyn here for a total of 5 day course with resolution of symptoms. We suspect that his lingering O2 requirement is at least in part due to slowly resorbing consolidation left over from his infection. He was requiring ___ of supplemental O2 by NC at time of discharge. # Pleural effusion, bilateral Patient with evidence of right pleural effusion. Etiology likely fluid overload given heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Pleural effusion resolved improved with diuresis and his oxygen requirement trended down to ___ NC. Given this, thoracentesis was deferred. # Atrial fibrillation Patient with chronic history of atrial fibrillation. In afib throughout this admission. Continued amiodarone and apixaban. Rates appropriately controlled. CHRONIC ISSUES ================ # Coronary artery disease s/p CABG Patient with history of 3 vessel CABG on ___ (___) and subsequent PCI to LAD (___). Continued home aspirin. Patient was started on low dose rosuvastatin 5 mg daily. On review, it appears he had been on this medication at this dose in the past but it was discontinued due to transamnitis; however, at the time it was unclear whether this was an effect of the statin or pembrolizumab. Given that the patient has not had his checkpoint inhibitor therapy since ___, the decision was to restart rosuvastatin. # Chronic kidney disease Baseline Cr appears to be 2.1-2.2 over past year. Cr remained between 1.8-2.4 throughout admission. # Anemia Chronic, although worsening since ___. On admission hemoglobin 10.6 and remained stable. # Thrombocytopenia Uncertain etiology, appears subacute/chronic. On admission platelets 130 down-trended to 100s. No concern for bleeding throughout admission. # Melanoma Patient with history of metastatic melanoma with unknown primary. On treatment with pembrolizumab, but held since ___ iso toxicity.

Importantly, patient was hospitalized at ___ on ___ with acute pleuritic chest pain of two-day duration in the context of constellation of fatigue, malaise, upper respiratory symptoms, and non-productive cough. While CTA exonerated pulmonary embolism, thickened pericardium and small effusion were noted, suggesting pericarditis. ECG revealed subtle diffuse ST elevations in keeping with pericarditis. Echocardiogram confirmed said effusion, though no features of tamponade were appreciated. He was discharged the same day with ibuprofen 600 mg TID and colchicine 0.6 mg BID. He had persistence of minor residual chest pain, which began to worsen two days later, but was tolerable until yesterday evening when it evolved to severe, unrelenting pain across his precordium likened to ""wearing shoulder pads bearing down on him."" He notes a new concurrent substernal chest pain that ""goes straight to his back."" He then became dyspneic, prompting him to seek care. He arrived at ___ hypotensive with SBP in the 80-range. He was borderline tachycardic and in mild respiratory distress, but oxygenation was acceptable. He rapidly received three liters of fluid for presumptive tamponade within the confines of poor windows on bedside echocardiogram. Pericardiocentesis yielded 400 cc or more of serous fluid and a pericardial drain was placed. Hemodynamics rapidly improved. On arrival to ___ ED, patient was indeed hemodynamically stable but was then in moderate respiratory distress, requiring non-rebreather. He was given Lasix 20 mg IV. Bedside echocardiogram was limited, but preliminarily suggestive of small residual effusion. In the CCU, patient notes resurgence of said chest pain. His dyspnea is improving. An additional 250 cc was drained. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Cardiac History: -Pericarditis, as above. -Hypertension. -Dyslipidemia.

WHAT WAS DONE WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL? - You were found to have inflammation and a build up of fluid in the lining of the heart. - You had a procedure to remove the fluid from the lining of the heart and a temporary drain placed. This was removed before you left the hospital. - You received medication to help you pee off the excess fluid in your body. - You developed an abnormal heart rhythm (afib) while in the hospital. You were started on a new medication for this (metoprolol). - You were diagnosed with diabetes during this admission. You were started on a new medication for this (metformin). WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? - Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below) - Follow up with your doctors as listed below - Weigh yourself every morning, seek medical attention if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. - Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms or you develop swelling in your legs, abdominal distention, or shortness of breath at night. Please see below for more information on your hospitalization. It was a pleasure taking part in your care here at ___! We wish you all the best! - Your ___ Care Team ","SUMMARY: ===================== ___ male with rheumatoid arthritis, DMARD holiday, and recent, brief hospitalization for presumptive pericarditis, returned to outside hospital with pericardial effusion with possible tamponade physiology now post-bedside pericardiocentesis prior to transfer, with persistent pericardial effusion now s/p drain placement with course complicated by acute hypercapneic respiratory distress. #CORONARIES: unknown. #PUMP: normal biventricular structure and function. #RHYTHM: NSR. pAF ___ TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== [] He was discharged on ibuprofen 600mg TID and colchicine 0.6mg BID for his inflammatory pericarditis. He should continue colchicine for 3 months. He should have his ibuprofen tapered weekly following resolution of his symptoms over 3 weeks to reduce the risk of recurrence. [] He was discharged on a PPI and should continue this while on ibuprofen. [] Strongly recommend that patient receive outpatient PFTs given high suspicion for baseline obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease [] Patient developed paroxysmal afib with RVR during this admission which is a new diagnosis. CHADSVASC 2 for hypertension and diabetes. Anticoagulation was not started during this admission given that he was felt to have relatively low risk for CVA, however please make a note of this new diagnosis and reassess need for anticoagulation as medically appropriate. [] He was newly diagnosed with DM (HbA1c 7.9 at ___ and will be discharged on metformin 500 BID. Will require outpatient follow-up for this and can consider uptitration in the outpatient setting. [] Please reassess need for diuretic in the outpatient setting. He had no echocardiographic evidence of heart failure during this admission so was not discharged on diuretics. New medications: Metformin 500mg BID Metoprolol XL 50mg QD Omeprazole 20mg QD Continued medications: Atorvastatin 10mg QPM Colchicine 0.6mg BID Ibuprofen 600mg TID Folic acid 1mg PO QD Sertraline 100mg PO QD Stopped medications: Methotrexate 20mg PO Famotidine 20mg QD ACUTE ISSUES: ============= #) Acute pericarditis #) Cardiac tamponade, now s/p pericardiocentesis and drain placement He presented with inflammatory pericarditis of probable viral nature in the context of viral-like prodrome versus rheumatic pericarditis, given serologic positive active disease in the absence of DMARD. Pericardial fluid cultures from ___ negative, cultures here with 1 colony on 1 plate of coag negative staph felt to be contaminant, negative acid fast smear. No biochemical evidence of myocardial injury on admission, unlikely to have concurrent myocarditis or cardiac event sequelae. At ___ was initially noted to have SBPs in the ___ and received fluid resuscitation and pericardiocentesis given concern for tamponade physiology. Hemodynamics subsequently stabilized and remained so throughout the duration of his admission here. TTE on ___ showed no pericardial effusion. Pericardial drain was initially left to gravity due to continued output, and was removed ___. He was treated with colchicine 0.6mg BID which he will continue for 3 months after discharge. He also received ibuprofen 600mg PO TID and will be discharged on a slow taper; he received PPI while receiving NSAIDs. #) Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure - resolving Probable flash pulmonary edema from rapid large-volume fluid administration on tamponade, as evidenced by radiographic pulmonary edema. Earlier echocardiogram otherwise not suggestive of ventricular dysfunction and BNP is within normal limits. TTE on ___ was without evidence of cardiac etiology for his pulmonary edema/respiratory failure. Patient likely has unappreciated restrictive pulmonary physiology. Additionally, no emphysematous changes noted on CT one week ago, but background obstructive defect is conceivable, given compelling smoking history. He had a negative CTA one week prior to admission. Patient had leukocytosis on admission without clear radiographic consolidation suggestive of pneumonia - one dose of empiric azithromycin was given overnight and discontinued on ___. He received IV diuresis with significant improvement in his respiratory status. O2 weaned ___ morning. He was breathing comfortably on RA at the time of discharge with ambulatory saturations >90%. #) Paroxysmal AFib, new diagnosis Patient went into Afib with RVR on ___, and subsequently received metoprolol. He subsequently flipped back into NSR. His CHADsVASC = 2 (DM, HTN). Anticoagulation was discussed but ultimately deferred at the time of discharge given the patient's lower overall risk for CVA and concerns regarding medication adherence/cost. He was discharged on metoprolol. He should have his need for anticoagulation reassessed as an outpatient as medically appropriate. #) Type II diabetes: He was newly diagnosed with DM with a A1C of 7.9% during this admission. He was maintained on an insulin sliding scale during this admission and will be discharged on metformin 500mg BID. CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: ==================== #) Rheumatoid arthritis: RF and anti-CCP positive per outpatient rheumatology. Not currently endorsing sx suggestive of RA flare. Per discussion with OP rheumatologist, deferred restarting MTX and/or other DMARD until outpatient. #) HTN His home BP meds were held initially due to soft BPs and were stopped at the time of discharge as he remained normotensive.

Ask your doctor when you can resume tub baths or swimming. HOW YOU MAY FEEL: o You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for a couple of weeks. You might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. o You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your throat during surgery. o You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. You might feel somewhat depressed. o You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem unappealing. o All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go away in a short time. If they do not, tell your surgeon. YOUR INCISION: o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. (These are the thin paper strips that might be on your incision.)

It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more medicine at one time than prescribed. o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your pain gets too severe. o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your surgeon has said its okay. o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of pain medicine. o Remember to use your ""cough pillow"" for splinting when you cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.

We believe your abdominal pain may be related to the liver but it could also be due to untreated H. pylori infection. We started you on medications to treat this infection and you will need to complete a full course of treatment. You should take these medications for ten days total (last dose on ___. While your liver tests were initially midly elevated, they have been trending towards normal again. You had no evidence of gall stones but your ultrasound and CT scan did show fatty liver. Some of your blood tests were not back yet and we recommend that you discuss these results with your primary care doctor and get repeat liver tests next week. Overall we were feel that you are safe to go home. Because you are experiencing constipation which can also contribute to your abdominal pain, we will send you home with some medications that will help you have regular bowel movements. Medicaion Changes START omeprazole 20mg twice a day, after ___ you can start taking your normal home dose of omeprazole once a day (to treat H pylori) START Amoxicillin 1000 mg every 12 hours (last dose on ___ to treat H pylori START Clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hours (last dose on ___ to treat H pylori Take the following medications if you have constipation Miralax Colace Take the following medications if you have pain Oxycodone (note this medication can make you constipated) Simethicone Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your care. ","# Elevated LFTs: CT, KUB and RUQ US did not show evidence of acute cholecystetis, despite the positive ___ sign. It is possible the patient has underlying viral hepatitis, the serologies were sent in the ED. We are reassured by downtrending LFTs. Iron studies were within normal limits making hemochromotosis less likely. The patient felt significant relief with his bowel movement, and therefore it is likely he had a degree of constipation contributing to his presentation. Troponins were negative and EKG was unremarkable making a cardiac etiology unlikely. He tolerated food well and his pain was significantly improved with minimal need for oxycodone. . # GERD/H. pylori: Patient has known history of GERD and is treated with prilosec with relief of symptoms. He also has a history of untreated H. pylory diagnosed in ___. The patient was given perscriptions at that time by his PCP but he never filled the perscriptions. We started treatment for presumed H. pylori with omeprazole 20mg BID, amoxicillin 1g BID and clarithromycin 500mg BID for ten days . # Anxiety: Patient takes sertraline 75mg daily, we will continue in house. . # Transition issues: Hepatitis serologies were pending at time of discharge. The patient also had stool studies which were pending. His LFTs have been trending downward, but he will need repeat LFTs once he follows up with his PCP. ",2536,322

The spectrum of findings could be seen in the setting of acute injury as in a grade 1 sprain of the acromioclavicular joint. However, given the absence of any history of trauma the findings are consistent with nonspecific myositis of the trapezius and deltoid muscles. Given the trace amount of fluid in the acromioclavicular joint superimposed infection in this region cannot be excluded. The amount of fluid would not be amenable to image-guided joint aspiration.

You were admitted to ___ with left shoulder pain. We sent a variety of lab tests that showed you have inflammation, however no obvious diagnosis. We asked our rheumatology team to see you as well. It is possible that you have both a problem in your joint as well as your muscles, and it may be as simple as a traumatic fall causing these symptoms. However, we did a muscle biopsy in an effort to get at the definitive diagnosis, and you should follow up with a rheumatologist about the results.

Pt was admitted to the medicine service where pain control was initiated with tylenol and oxycodone. His renal failure resolved with IVF. Trial of NSAIDs was used x 2 however each with bump in Cr, so pt was discharged off of NSAIDs. Rheumatology was consulted and as per their recommendations, MRI of thighs was done (read in previous section) and mm bx of left deltoid done with with ACS c/s. Given lack of microrganisms on the gram stain, and PMNs likely c/w inflammation, steroids were started once an infx was r/o. The patient was also seen by ___ who recommended outpt ___ as well as shoulder exercises for the patient. Statin was briefly stopped, however restarted given normalizing CK with hydration. # Myositis/arthropathy - Upon presentation, ddx was broad and as such, many tests were checked including ASO (titer 400-800, positive), lyme serology (negative), CK for statin induced myopathy (400, resolved with IVF), and trichinella Ab (pending at time of discharge). Pt's family most concerned with PMR, however reassured pattern does not seem c/w this. ESR and CRP were checked which were elevated (87 and 243 respectively). Blood Cx were also checked given possible pyomyositis, thought from diabetic foot ulcer, however they remained NGTD throughout hospitalization. Rheumatology was c/s who felt that MRI thigh was indicated which showed unilateral myositis in the left quadriceps group. Notably, on exam the patient seemed to show pain to both passive and active movement, and as such we felt that he likely had both a problem in his joints as well as the actual muscles. A muscle biopsy was done with the ___ team c/s which upon initial gram stain was negative for microorganisms, which allowed us to start steroids (we were concerned about possible pyomyositis). Also of concern was diabetic myonecrosis, however unlikely given that multiple mm groups with different blood supply was involved. Rheumatology felt it was possible that the pain in both the left AC joint as well as the pes anserinus on the right leg (which developed on HD3), may both be crystal arthropathy/bursitis, and as such recommended steroids. We held off on empiric steroids until after the bx, and upon initiation, drastic improvement on sxs was noted. Ultimately, thought was that possibly myositis ___ traumatic fall on left hand side with underlying crystal arthropathy (however not enough fluid on MRI or US to tap). he will have rheumatology f/u in the ___ system, and our rheumatology c/s attdg will attempt to contact his outpt rheumatologist for continuity of care. He was discharged with a prednisone taper and close f/u with his PCP. # Acute renal failure - Fena was <1%, and BUN/Cr ratio >10. As such thought was that this was likely prerenal. With hydration, Cr down to 1.0. NSAIDs were attempted for pain relief which helped, unfortunately his Cr again bumped so NSAIDs were discontinued and the patient was asked to avoid them at time of discharge. # Diabetes - continued home regimen of lantus and HISS. Notably, pt did have higher blood sugars upon initation of his steroids. The patient was advised to closely monitor his BS at home to cover himself with SSI. notably, diabetic myonecrosis was on the ddx however we felt this was unlikely given the location of the myositis. There was also thought of possible contribution of his diabetes and insulin usage to a possible adhesive capsulitis in the left shoulder. # Anemia: Pt's hct was 40 upon presentation, and dropped to 32 over his hospitalization in the setting of aggressive hydration for ARF. Notably, guaiac was negative, and iron studies were c/w anemia of chronic inflammation # Constipation: Pt developed narcotic induced constipation, and an aggressive bowel regimen was written for him. he required an enema in order to pass stools, and as such, he was discharged with an aggressive prescription regimen for his constipation. # Foot ulcer: Pt has known DM with foot ulcer, followed by podiatry. Wound c/s was asked to see patient who assisted with foot ulcer care. No concern of osteo. Out of slight concern of possible contribution to a ""pyomyositis-like picture,"" we checked blood Cx which were negative at time of discharge. # Hypertension - continued atenolol. # History of CAD - continued ASA, atenolol as prior. Statin was briefly stopped and reinitiated at time of discharge given normal CK. # FOLLOW UP ISSUES Pt had blood cx and a trichinella ag test pending at time of discharge Pt will need to f/u with rheumatology within ___. Our rheumatology attending at the ___ will attempt to contact his new rheumatologist for continuity of care. ",3094,1078

He originally presented ___ with progressive left shoulder, Right knee, and Left thigh pain for several weeks. During this hospitalization, a rheumatology consult was obtained. He had an MRI of the Left shoulder that showed edema in the trapezius and deltoid muscles, consistent with nonspecific myositis and trace amount of fluid in the acromioclavicular joint. MRI of the thigh showed myositis involving the left quadriceps. Ultrasound of the shoulder showed no focal fluid collection. A muscle biopsy of the left shoulder muscle was also performed, final path is still pending but gram stain was negative and to date tissue cultures have been negative. Remainder of the extensive workup included: lyme, ASO, and blood cultures that have all been negative, GC/chlamydia still are pending. Pt was sent home and started a short course of steroids which he completed ___ for presumed inflammatory myositis. Pt states that on discharge he had some improvement in his shoulder pain with the steroids. On day of admission, he had fevers to 101, rigors and chills. He denies rash, nausea, dyspnea, recent trauma or surgeries. He was seen by his PCP on the day of admission for increaced pain and new cellulities of the Left foot. Labs showed elevated ESR/CRP (100/202) concerning for acute infection. He was then evaluated by rheumatology, where his AC joint was again aspirated this time with fluid washout and a prelim culture/gramstain grew gram positive cocci.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL? - You were having pain in your throat and body. You were not getting enough to eat and drink. Because of this, you were weaker than usual, which made your old stroke symptoms seem worse. Your children were concerned that you were more confused than usual. WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL? - You received scans to make sure that you did not have a new stroke. - You were watched closely for signs of infection. - You were supported with fluids and nutritious food. - You underwent an endoscopy procedure, which showed a lot of inflammation that is probably causing your swallowing pain. You were given liquid lidocaine for throat pain, as well as an acid blocker medicine. - Your body pain was treated with morphine. WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? - Continue to take all your medicines and keep your appointments. We wish you the best! Sincerely, Your ___ Team ","SUMMARY: ========= ___ w/ stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma of lung, s/p completion of concurrent ___ ___, also w/ a h/o multiple strokes w/ residual left hemiparesis, HTN, DL, and prior colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy who is transferred from ___ for continuity of care after presenting there w/ confusion and worsening LUE weakness. ACTIVE ISSUES: ============ #Odynophagia/Dysphagia: Most likely radiation esophagitis, reflux esophagitis. ___ EGD with esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis. Gastric biopsy showed H. pylori. She was given viscous lidocaine with meals, BID PPI, fluids as needed, and a regular diet. We had long discussions about her goals of care with both her outpatient oncology team as well as her palliative care team (detailed below) and it was ultimately decided to not pursue full antibiotic therapy for H. pylori as her primary symptom of odynophagia is most likely primarily related to strictures and radiation esophagitis. #Failure to thrive Seems like most likely etiology is poor po intake. Felt to be due to progressive esophagitis (presumably radiation induced). She has odynophagia. TSH wnl. No e/o pulmonary infection. UA neg at OSH. C diff negative this admission. Geriatrics was involved in the patient's care during this admission. Her throat and body pain was controlled with IV morphine, and she received viscous lidocaine to help her eat/drink more comfortably. She was supported with IVF as needed. ___ and OT evaluated her and recommended rehab placement however after long discussions of her GOC and it was decided that she would not want tube feeding and would like to go home on hospice. #Nonocclusive thrombus in right IJ In the setting of being hypercoagulable from malignancy. HAS-BLED score is 3 (HTN, stroke Hx, age she is at high risk for major bleeding, but is hypercogulable iso malignancy. The definitive treatment for her hypercoagulable state is treatment of her malignancy, if within GOC. Her home ASA/Plavix were continued, and she was started on enoxaparin 80 mg SC daily, with the plan to treat for 1 month. #Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma #Bilateral lytic scapular lesions Most recent imaging, CT chest on ___, revealed substantial decrease in size of the pre-existing right hilar mass, which now measures 20 x 20 mm in diameter. However CT abd revealed ""new 1.3 cm hepatic segment VII lesion ... suspicious for metastasis."" ___ elevated this admission, consistent with liver involvement. Now CT from ___ revealed new bilateral lytic scapular lesions. Outpatient team arranging PET scan in ___, with future cancer treatment directed therapies to be determined. Her outpatient oncology team (Drs ___ was contacted with updates. Hip/femur x-rays were obtained to eval for osseous/lytic lesions (because of delays with scheduling a bone scan). #Encephalopathy She's been having episodes of confusion for some time now per daughter. She locked herself in the bathroom last week. ""Thetiles have me locked in the bathroom and I can't get out."" But the bathroom was not locked. A few weeks ago, she had left the stove on during a hot day, and she stated she was heating food for her son (who was murdered ___. Daughter is concerned about dementia. MRI brain did not reveal mets or new stroke. although pt is oriented x 3, she seems to have poor insight into reason for admission and her hospitalization. Confusion possibly also due to impaired sleep (sleeps during day, as lives with her son who works nights), dehydration, pain from malignancy. Geriatrics was consulted and assisted with her care. Her nutrition and hydration status were optimized and her pain was controlled with IV morphine. She received high dose thiamine for possible Wernicke's encephalopathy. She received folic acid repletion for severe protein calorie malnutrition. CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES: ======================== #Worsening LUE and LLE weakness - stable #History of CVA w/ residual hemiparesis Likely recrudescence from prior CVA and improved w/ hydration and nutrition. Her home aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin were continued. Her neurologic status was checked daily. She was started on Lovenox ___aily. #Severe protein calorie malnutrition: - Nutrition was consulted. She received a regular diet, high dose thiamine, folic acid and MVI. Her electrolytes were monitored daily and repleted as needed. #Tobacco Abuse: Continued nicotine patch. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== [] Due to esophageal spasms seen during EGD, outpatient esophageal mannometry should be considered to further work up her dysphagia/odynophagia. [] Consider starting a bisphosphonate, if osseous metastases are confirmed through bone scan/bone biopsy. Code status: DNR/DNI EMERGENCY CONTACT HCP: ___ (daughter) ___ This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.

","This ___ yo woman was admitted with complaints to gait instability and slowness of speech as outlined in the HPI. She had an otherwise normal neuro exam, but given her history of prior stroke and vascular risk factors, she received a brain MRI and MRA of the head and neck, which showed 2 small infarcts in the right lenticulostriate area and right frontal subcortical area. These were thought to be due to a small vessel disease. Her MRA was unrevealing. Her bloodwork revealed elevated lipids, for which she was started on Zetia and omega-3 fatty acids as she indicated that she could not tolerate lipitor in the past because it made her weak. Her HgbA1C was mildly elevated to 6.7, and she was counceled that she may have, at the least, glucose intolerence. She was instructed to modify her diet, be physically active, and follow this up with her PCP. Because she became angry when told of the possibilty of diabetes, these instructions, along with her med changes, were discussed with both her son and daughter. She was also counceled to stop smoking, and to be compliant with her medications. The patient will be scheduled for an echicardiogram as an outpatient to complete her work-up. ",2241,272

It will be very important that you have a colonoscopy as an outpatient. Please call ___ to schedule your colonoscopy. Please try to schedule this before your ___ appointments. If you should have more abdominal pain, chest pain, bleeding or any other concerning symptom, please let your doctor know. Again, it was our pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the best! -- Your ___ Medicine Team -- ","PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: Mrs. ___ is a ___ h/o stage III splenic flexure colon cancer s/p resection, DMII, CAD, HTN who presents from clinic with one episode of bright red blood per rectum this morning. ACTIVE ISSUES: # Rectal Bleeding: Patient with mild abdominal pain earlier today with small amount of blood in stool and on toilet paper. It is likely that her abdominal pain could have been gas pain given the mild intermittent crampy nature that resolved with passing gas. Hemodynamically she was stable, Hct was normal and she had no further bleeding. Given she does have hemorrhoids, it is most likely that this is the cause of her bleeding, but given her history of colorectal cancer, she should have expedited outpatient colonoscopy.

The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are: hypertension hyperlipidemia extensive tobacco use We are changing your medications as follows: Plavix 75mg DAILY Atovarstatin 80mg DAILY Please take your other medications as prescribed. It is important to comply with the prescribed regimen and to STOP smoking. Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician as listed below. If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms: - sudden partial or complete loss of vision - sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth - sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to you - sudden weakness of one side of the body - sudden drooping of one side of the face - sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body - sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech) - sudden blurring or doubling of vision - sudden onset of vertigo (sensation of your environment spinning around you) - sudden clumsiness of the arm and leg on one side or sudden tendency to fall to one side (left or right) - sudden severe headache accompanied by the inability to stay awake It was a pleasure providing you with care during this hospitalization. The ___ Neurology service ","___ year old woman with prior paramedian pontine infarct (___) and right-sided lenticulostriate territory infarct (___), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, colon cancer s/p resection and chemotherapy in ___, and extensive tobacco use who presents with acute onset left sided weakness concerning for stroke. #left sided weakness: On the day of admission (___), patient's left-sided weakness improved without a history of sensory changes or other neurological symptoms. Her exam on admission was notable for left SCM, deltoid, and triceps weakness, as well as mild weakness of her left IP and brisker reflexes on the left. Patient underwent CT head, which revealed a new hypodensity in the right frontal lobe, suggesting for acute and subacute infarct, particularly given her extensive history of infarcts in the past. Patient also underwent MRI brain and MRA, which showed multiple R-sided scattered infarcts that could explain her symptoms. Her infarcts seemed embolic. We wondered about artery-to-artery due to atherosclerotic ICA disease vs. cardioembolic source. Of note, patient admitted that she was non-compliant with her meds and continues to smoke. Echo showed LVEF >55% with no masses or thrombi. She was sent home with a Holter monitor x 30 days. Because of patient's risk factors, she was started on Plavix 75mg. It was discussed with patient that she needed to be on high dose statin therapy, and atorvastatin 80mg would be recommended, but patient declined atorva stating that she had a side effect to another statin other than rosuvastatin, and preferred to stay on rosuvastatin. I explained that Crestor would not be ideal with current guidelines, but based on her preference, she was sent home with Crestor 40mg daily. Upon discharge, patient was back to her baseline functional level and was symptom-free. She will continue to follow up with Dr. ___ in the clinic. =========================================================== AHA/ASA Core Measures for Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack 1.

ACUTE ISSUES: ==================== # Odynophagia/Dysphagia #Radiation Esophagitis Managed with oral liquid lidocaine formulation, which improved patient's ability to tolerate PO. Speech and language pathology consutled, recommended soft ground diet and thin liquids, which was advanced to regular solids. Nutrition consulted as well. If symptoms fail to improve with liquid lidocaine and with a time course consistent with radiation esophagitis, will need further workup as outpatient, such as barium swallow or EGD. Patient was started on lansoprazole for any contribution of GERD, should continue to assess need for PPI as an outpatient. # Hypernatremia Patient with rising Na this admission, up to 149. Likely poor oral intake iso radiation esophagitis. Patient received 1L D5W with improvement of Na to 141 on day of discharge. She was encouraged to maintain liquids throughout the day. # Severe Malnutrition Patient with poor PO intake and weight loss. Nutrition was consulted, and per their recommendations she received Carnation supplements with soy milk with meals, as well as Ensure Clear with meals and multivitamins. PO intake was encouraged. SW was consulted due to concern about her having adequate resources at home (but she denies having issues with resources). ___ assessed her and recommended home, where she already has a walker. OOB with assistance was encouraged during the admission. # Vitamin B12 deficiency B12 was noted to be low this admission, so the patient received cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM on ___ and was started on PO cyanocobalamin daily. MMA was obtained, which was pending at time of discharge. CBC was obtained daily. # Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma Undergoing concurrent chemoradiation. Will follow up with Dr. ___ as outpatient. CHRONIC ISSUES: ================= # Hypokalemia, chronic Hypokalemia has been chronic. Etiology unclear as patient is not on diuretics. Other etiologies include kidney dysfunction such as rental tubular acidosis. Reportedly does not take potassium as often as necessary at home d/t difficulty swallowing pill. Urine electrolytes notable for >20 K which seems inappropriate in setting of hypokalemia. Potassium powder was trialed during the admission. # Diarrhea, stable Patient reports loose stool since radiation. On admission did report blood in stool that is streaky and superficial; patient denied tarry stools or frank blood. The most concerning etiology would be recurrence of colorectal carcinoma (s/p hemicolectomy), although more likely causes include diverticulosis flare or hemorrhoidal bleeding. Cdiff negative. Hb stable throughout this admission. # Tobacco Abuse: Managed inpatient with nicotine patch. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: =========================== [] Ensure that patient is eating and drinking without difficulty [] Continue to assess for presence of blood in stools [] Should repeat CBC and BMP at next PCP visit to ensure stable Hb and Na/K [] Previously on potassium tablets, but discharged on potassium powder given odynophagia, will need to follow up with ability to tolerate this. [] Patient was started on lansoprazole for any contribution of GERD, should continue to assess need for PPI as an outpatient. [] Found to have B12 deficiency anemia during this admission, received cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM on ___ and was started on PO cyanocobalamin daily, which she should continue. [] Follow up on lab tests that were pending at time of discharge: campylobacter stool culture, stool ova + parasites, fecal culture r/o Yersinia, methylmalonic acid. [] Patient was scheduled for outpatient CT chest ___, unable to complete as an inpatient, will need to be rescheduled by her oncology team ========================== CODE: Full Code (confirmed) EMERGENCY CONTACT HCP: ___ (daughter) ___ ",2703,880

","___ PMHx obesity, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CKD III (baseline 1.4) and chronic multiple myeloma and adenocarcinoma of anal canal (dx'ed ___ presenting for AFib with RVR. ACUTE ISSUES: ------------- # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Pt presented initially with RVR in the 140s. Most likely in the setting of B-blocker and CCB being held due to hypotension. C. diff infection (see below) most likely contributing to hypotension. Pt received IV metoprolol and IV diltiazem in ED and was started on PO metoprolol/diltiazem on floor. She was also fluid resuscitated. Patient discharged with control of afib with RVR with PO metop and diltiazem at home doses. INR was supratherapeutic and coumadin was held (see below). # Hypotension: Per nursing home, she had intermittent hypotension requiring discontinuation of her metoprolol and diltiazem. Most likely secondary to decreased PO intake/loose stools from C.diff infection. Adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroid use in the setting of infection was ruled out with AM cortisol (30). # Funguria, bacteruria: Pt initially reported dysuria and UA x2 showed large leuks/bacteria/yeast. Despite being contaminated, due to symptoms of dysuria, she was initially treated with IV CTX. Urine cultures eventually grew only yeast, prompting discontinuation of CTX. She was no longer symptomatic at this time, and she had no CVA tenderness or systemic symptoms of infection. She had a foley place initially for urine output monitoring, however, this was removed. Funguria will be treated with fluconazole for total 7 days of therapy. # C.difficile infection: Although no recent history of antibiotics, patient immunosuppressed and at rehabilitation facility. She was initially started on PO metronidazole on ___, but this was changed to PO vanc, given that she is immunosuppresed and falls into the severe category. ___, ___. # Coagulopathy: INR on admission was 6.5. Most likely secondary to decreased PO ntake and exacerbated antibiotics. No active signs of bleeding. Once INR reached 7.8, she was given 2.5 mg PO vitamin K. She received additional 2.5 mg PO vitamin K on ___. Coumadin was held on discharge. # Acute on chronic CKD (stage 3): Cr 1.2 (baseline 0.8-1.1). Most likely secondary to decreased PO intake and decreased cardiac output from afib with RVR. Creatinine improved with IVF. # Lower extremity edema: Multi-factorial. Most likely venous stasis vs diastolic heart failure, especially in the setting of afib with RVR, vs hypoalbuminemia. Pa/lateral film in ED showed no cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascualar congestion to suggest decompensated systolic heart failure. Pt on furosemide at home. Albumin was 3.0.

Per Urology, pt's INR needs to be <3.0 and she will need this procedure in the next ___ months. # Troponinemia: Most likely strain from RVR vs decreased clearance in the setting of ___. Peaked at 0.02 before downtrending. # Hyperlactatemia: Lactate 2.6 on admission. Most likely secondary to dehydration versus ineffective cardiac output from RVR. Peaked at 2.6 before downtrending. CHRONIC ISSUES: --------------- # Weakness: She had generalized total body weakness, with the lower extremities worse than upper extremities. Also with the left ___ greater than right ___. No documented previous CVA to which asymmetry can be attributed. Most likely deconditioning and myopathy from dexamethasone, versus myositis or cerebrovascular event, both thought unlikely. CK was within normal limits. ___ worked with patient and she was discharged back to rehab. # Leg pain: Most likely osteoarthritis. She does not have diabetes to suggest neuropathy. She continued home oxycodone 10 mg qHS. # Pancytopenia: Patient with stable neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia improved from prior, thought to be secondary to lenalidomide as well as anemia of chronic disease. # Anal adenocarcinoma: Diagnosed recently in ___.

Course complicated by AMS due to delirium, A fib with RVR, and pseudomonal infection. She was transferred to the floor on ___. Floor course was remarkable for wound dehiscence, continued afib with occasional RVR and ongoing delirium. # Hypotension: Most likely due to volume loss (8hr procedure with persistent oozing) compounded by third spacing from SIRS DIC response with hypoalbuminemia and anesthesia with delayed renal clearance and finaly RVR with poor filling time. Estimated blood loss was 1L though poorly quantified given the extent of the procedure. Intraop she received 6L crystalloid, 4 PRBC, and albumin (by report though unable to find in OMR), and her post op crit nevertheless dropped from 32 to 22. Post op bleeding possible with DIC (INR 1.2->2.4) and thrombocytopenia nadir 39, though there are no outward signs of blood loss- hemostasis was noted at closure, the incisions have been dry with no significant drains putting out appropriate though dark serosanguanous fluid. Patient required pressor support with phenylephrine, noepinephrine, and vasopressin post-operatively. Patient was empirically covered with vanc/zosyn briefly, though this was discontinued given no clear source of infection. Patient experienced recurrent hypotension on ___ after returning from OR on ___. This was felt to be due to intra-operative blood loss and fluid shifts. She received 1U PRBCs on ___ intra-operatively and again on ___ due to drop in H/H. BP improved with IVF bolus, blood transfusions, and improved control of A fib with RVR. # DIC: INR rose 1.2-> 2.4, platelets dipped to 39 with occasionaly schistos. This is likely from the procedure, no evidence of infection, and it appears to have responded to FFP with stable fibrinogen not requiring cryo. No evidence of petichiae, no appreciable oozing from lines and wounds. SQ heparin was discontinued, then restarted on ___ once platelets > 50. Thrombocytopenia improved during ICU course. It gradually resolved and normalized by ___. # Afib: Previously on warfarin and rate controlled with dilt, bridged with lovenox and dilt recently decreased to 120 due to soft systolics during previous admission. Patient was controlled with dilt gtt and was also briefly on amiodarone. Patient was then transitioned to PO metoprolol and diltiazem for ongoing rate control. # Anal Mucinous Adenocarcinoma Diagnosed in ___.

She was also started on flagyl post-operatively ___. Deep wound culture from OR on ___ grew Pseudomonas, sparse growth, for which she was started on cefepime on ___. She was switched to IV cipro based on sensitivities and antibiotics were discontinued on ___. The Right side JP was removed on ___ as well since the opening of wound exposed the JP to air and was not able to hold suction. The Left side JPs were left in place. #wound: midline wound dehisced, requiring wet to dry dressing changes daily. It is in the proximity of the ostomy and application of wound vac would be very difficult to manage at this location. we continued with wet to dry dresssing allowing it to heal via second intention. #thromboses: patient with new LUE swelling on ___, found to have thrombosis associated with PICC on U/S. Also has non-occlussive L IJ thrombosis, likely secondary to prior trauma line. Discontinued PICC ___ and patient was not anticoagulated, after discussion with surgery and heme/onc the decision was not to anti-coagulate due to ongoing wound complications and poor overall prognosis. #AMS: most likely secondary to ICU delirium with waxing and waning mental status. Mental status improved significantly during ICU course and patient was placed on seroquel qhS PRN. This was continued while on the floor. Her mentation did not improve much and has ongoing delirium. # Lactic acidosis: Combination of tissue disruption from surgery and hypoperfusion from above. Lactate improved with improved BP. #nutrition: patient with low albumin and pre-albumin levels with poor nutrtional status likely contributing to poor wound healing. She was restarted on TFs post-operatively when cleared by surgery. She was seen by ___ who recommended soft solids and thin liquids, along with supplemental tube feeds. A dobhoff was placed and bridled in the ICU. We continued TF at goal after she was transferred to the floor. She tolerated the TF without issues. # left ___ finger fracture: no op. ",5035,1230

Became hypotensive and quite anemic on the floor with H/H of ___ and was transferred to the MICU ___. She peacefully passed away with her family and family pastor present in the room at ___ on ___. #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The pt consistently required nasal cannula up to 6 L while on the floor. This was thought to be due to volume overload and increased work of breathing. While in the CCU pt became more lethargic and an ABG showed hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was intubated by anesthesia. CXR showed large bilateral pleural effusions and she was grossly anasarcic. IP placed a right chest tube to drain the effusion which showed that it was malignant with cytology showing adenocarcinoma. She was extubated successfully on ___ and was weaned down to room air thereafter. She was able to be comfortable on room air for the rest of her admission. # Encephalopathy: although the pt's mental status had noticed to be declining on the floor, she was still able to answer appropriately. After extubation, the pt was noted to be very lethargic and minimally responsive. EEG was done which showed triphasic waves consistent with an encephalopathy. The pt was trialed on Ativan and Keppra. Her mental status remained very poor in spite of continued Keppra. Neuro signed off after head imaging was unrevealing. Mental status continued to wax and wane through the rest of her time. # Stage IV surgical dehiscence: Patient had correction of abdominoperineal resection defect with a right vertical rectus abdominis muscular cutaneous flap in ___ following resection of anal cancer. She presented to the hospital with stage IV, MRSA + sacral ulcer with concern for osteomyelitis, as wound probes to bone. CT scan with no mention of sacral osteomyelitis. GI deferred to plastics as they did flap surgery. Plastics does not recommend surgical intervention at this time. MRI shows no signs of osteomyelitis. This wound remained stable during her hospital course. # ___: Baseline Creatinine 0.8. Creatinine on admission was 2.1 in setting of diuresis but also possible hypotension from afib with RVR. Pt is grossly volume overloaded with hypoalbumenemia. Concern for prerenal vs. intrinsic with possible multiple myeloma involvement vs obstructive. Creatinine remains above 2.0 today. Renal consulted and believed that her ___ was predominantly secondary to obstruction. After stent exchange by urology ___, renal function improved with a Cr to 1.5 with IV fluids and remained stable. # Gastric Distension: Patient developed nausea and 1 episode of vomiting ___ with increasing distention. And xray ___ showed significant gastric distension. NG tube was placed and >1L was drawn off. Patient's reported symptomatic improvement. Patient continued to have ostomy output throughout episode. No mass appreciated on exam though obese abdomen. Patient not on narcotic medication. On ___, NG tube was clamped without recurrence of distention, patient denies nausea or distension. Unable to get CT abd due to poor kidney function, but got OSH CT read by our radiologists. It was notable for new retroperitoneal mass encasing aorta throughout abdomen. It is touching and possibly invading ___ and ___ portion of duodenum, potentially explaining gastric obstruction symptoms. Invades pancreatic head, explaining ductal dilatation. Also surrounding common iliac vessels, and both ureters (hydronephrosis worse since ___. Speech and swallow was consulted who said the pt should be strict NPO. Tube feeds were started. # Tube feeds: On ___ Ms. ___ was no longer tolerating her tube feeds due to very high residuals. Tube feeds were stopped and she was given nutrition with D5NS at 75/hr. ___ attempted to place the Dobhoff tube post-pyloric but they were unable to pass the tube through the pylorus and noted contrast barely trickles through ___ obstruction. In family meetings the family was informed that the feeding tube could not be advanced, and that other options such as TPN would likely harm the pt more than help her because of her risk for bloodstream infection and metabolic derangements. # Metastatic anal adenocarcinoma: large retroperitoneal mass compressing the abdomen and constricting the aorta at the level of the iliacs noted on CT from OSH, thought to be metastasis from her known anal adenocarcinoma. Per onc, not a candidate for chemotherapy, so likely not worth biopsying even though definitive diagnosis would not otherwise be reached. Recommend getting palliative care involved and having goals of care discussion with family. First family meeting was ___ and son, ___, wanted us to do everything we could to help Ms. ___. This continued to be a theme during her hospital stay, and several meetings were held with the family to discuss goals of care. On ___ it was decided to switch to focusing on her comfort only. # Volume overload: Likely from diastolic heart failure but will need to rule out hypoalbuminemic state, and cirrhosis. Patient with gross volume overload with 2+ ___ edema, bilateral effusions and CT with anasarca on abdominal imaging. TTE unchanged from previous with EF 55% and no gross valvular dysfunction. TSH elevated, T4 WNLs. Patient given albumin ___ with good response. However, patient still significantly overloaded. On ___ she was anuric and hypotensive despite having significant lower extremity and abdominal edema. She was transferred to the MICU on this day. While in the MICU she was stabilized and pressors were downtitrated. Poor response to Lasix alone but given Lasix and Chlorothiazide with good UOP. # Hematuria: Unclear cause but patient was on anticoagulation. Concern would be primarily for tumor infiltration. Hematuria intermittent, but seems to recur during transport. Potential mechanical irritation. Patient continues to pass dime sized clots. Stent exchange done ___ by urology, with improvement in her hematuria. Hematuria with clots returned on ___. Urology recommended CBI which was started ___. She had CBI intermittently throughout her stay to relieve foley obstructions. # Normocytic Anemia: Hgb at ___ 8.6. No evidence of bleeding. She does have stage III CKD. MCV within normal range and iron studies not particularly suggestive of iron deficiency anemia with ferritin of 781. Folate level of 7.4 and B12 of 411. Concern could possibly be for chronic low grade bleed from gut or hematuria. (transfused evening of ___. Hgb remained stable in the 7's until ___ when H/H dropped to ___. This same day she triggered for hypotension of 86/Doppler. As she was anuric at this time there was concern of intraabdominal bleeding and was one of the indications for MICU transfer. Pt had episode of gross hematuria requiring CBI and pRBC transfusion for BP control. Pt required Vasopressin and Phenylephrine while in the MICU but was able to be weaned off. She required intermittent pRBC transfusions during her time in the MICU. # AFib on coumadin: CHADS 2 of 3. Hemodynamically unstable with RVR upon arrival, but controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol. She remained in AFib during her hospital stay. Due to her hematuria and dropping H/H, blood pressure medications and ultimately SQH were discontinued on ___. Pt put on an esmolol gtt as she had afib with RVR into the 130s on her first day in the ICU. She was taken off the esmolol drip and thereafter controlled with IV metoprolol and achieved good control on PO metoprolol with heart rates in the ___. # Hypertension: Currently normotensive. See above for issues with hypotension and reason for MICU transfer ___. # IgG Myeloma: Patient with longstanding IgG MM, followed by ___ Oncology. Currently not on revlimid or dexamethasone. Kappa:lamba increase, but can be seen in kidney disease. Atrius oncology followed patient throughout hospital stay. ==================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== - Family Bereavement Counseling ",3295,1914

You were also having chest pain, but this resolved with maalox and your heart tests were normal. STOP taking hydrochlorothiazide. None of your other medications were changed. ","Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of falls, chronic headaches, and poor oral intake who is admitted for failure to thrive. . * Gait instability This is probably multifactorial. Dehydration was a significant factor upon admission. Her hyponatremia, likely hypovolemic in etiology, may also have been relevant to her overall sense of weakness. Though she was admitted with concern for possible Parkinsons, she does not have any clear exam findings to suggest this such as tremor or cogwheeling. NPH is worth considering, but seems less likely. There may be a vestibular component of her gait instability as well, especially given her multiple ENT procedures. She has outpatient neurology follow-up scheduled. A cardiac contribution was considered given her history of prior syncope with question of sick sinus syndrome. After fluid resuscitation, patient no longer orthostatic and Na trending up. She was evaluated by physical therapy who felt that it was safe for her to go home with physical therapy. . * Hyponatremia By history, likely hypovolemic in etiology and improving on discharge. HCTZ could be contributory, and was held on discharge as patient appeared euvolemic with good BP control off the HCTZ. Patient stated her appetite was better on discharge (possible hyponatremia was contributing). . * Bradycardia Prior cardiac workup raised question of sick sinus syndrome, and patient had bradycardic rate, <2 second pauses on tele. TSH was within normal limits. Outpatient cardiology follow-up is scheduled with Dr. ___. . # Noncardiac Chest pain On evening of admission, patient c/o left sided stabbing pain under her rib, worse when she pressed on it and also following a meal. No N/V/SOB/diaphoresis/radiation. She was ruled out for MI with serial unchanged ECGs, two sets negative CE. Her pain resolved with maalox and tylenol and did not return. . * Headaches Appears to be consistent with her chronic headache syndrome, thought to be cervical in etiology by neurology. History less suggestive of other etiologies such as migraine, tension, or even temporal arteritis (but ESR was 3). Continued soft cervical collar at night per neuro recs. Pain resolved with tylenol. . * Anemia Seen by ___ as an outpatient, felt to be related to CRI and some degree of iron deficiency. Gets regular epo and iron infusions. No history of recent gross bleeding. B12, folate, retic, RBC morph, SPEP/UPEP all wnl. No guaiac positive stools during hospitalization. . * Hypertension In setting of dehydration, held ACEI and HCTZ. HCTZ held on discharge as above. SBP's in 130's at time of discharge. In outpatient setting might consider adding amlodipine. She did not have a true allergy to CCBs, only peripheral edema. . * CAD. Continued ASA and statin. Not on BB as outpatient, and continued to hold as she was mildly bradycardic. ",1812,658

You were admitted for an episode of dizziness and falling. You had been taking HCTZ, a diuretic which can lead to dehydration and low sodium levels in your blood. Your sodium level was low, and improved before you left the hospital. You were treated with intravenous fluids and the HCTZ was stopped. You did well with physical therapy and your heart rate and blood pressure were normal. . You also had leg swelling. This is caused by chronic venous insufficiency, which means that the valves in your veins get leaky over time and cause blood to pool in your legs. The treatment for this is elevating your legs and wearing compression stockings. . The following changes were made to your medications - STOP taking HCTZ ","___ yo ___ speaking F with CAD, chronic ear infection who presents with presyncope and fall at home. . # Presyncope: Likely orthostasis in setting of HCTZ use and possible mild dehydration. Hyponatremia may have also contributed. Patient ruled out for MI. Neurological exam had no focal deficits. There was no evidence of infection, however urine cx was pending at discharge. Patient has bradycardia ___ SSS, but this is a chronic issue and patient is asymptomatic with bradycardia on the floor, and responded appropriately to exercise. No events on tele. Patient was not orthostatic after receiving gentle IVF. Physical therapy consult cleared patient for independent ambulation with walker. HCTZ was discontinued. Patient will have her BP monitored off this medication by her PCP, and may require a replacement medication. Amitrityline was another candidate for causing confusion and falls, however patient has noted benefit from this in terms of headaches. If falls continue, could consider stopping Amitrityline as well. . # Hyponatremia: Patient has h/o hyponatremia in setting of HCTZ, possibly with mild SIADH component as well (since Na did not completely normalize when taken off of HCTZ). Patient had brain MRI as outpatient which showed only moderate microvascular disease, which is unlikely to explain hyponatremia. Patient does have evidence of COPD on CXR, but no other intrathoracic pathology to cause SIADH. Urine osm were intermediate, so no clear SIADH picture. Patient did start taking HCTZ taking on her own over the last few days for leg swelling. This likely accounted for worsened hyponatremia at admission. After holding the HCTZ, giving IVF, and encouraging POs, sodium was in normal range. Patient was instructed not to take HCTZ, and to instead use compression stockings for leg edema. . # Lower extremity edema: This was very consistent with chronic venous insufficiency. Patient describes swelling that only occurs over the course of the day, and improves with rest and elevation. She has not been wearing compression stockings. Otherwise patient had no evidence of volume overload on exam. She is at risk for CHF given CAD and past MI, and should continue to weight herself daily. . # Sick sinus syndrome: Followed by Dr ___ as outpatient. No need for pacemaker given appropriate response to exercise. This episode is highly unlikely to be cardiac in etiology. Sinus bradycardia on tele. Asymptomatic. . # L gluteal pain: No fracture noted on L-spine films. Likely soft tissue trauma from fall. . # Hypercalcemia: Borderline and chronic, with mildly elevated PTH in past. This degree is very unlikely to be causing symptoms. . # Anemia: Hct 28 in baseline range. . # HTN: continue lisinopril. . # Hyperlipidemia: continue statin . #: Headaches: chronic, likely related to chronic ear infections/mastoiditis. . # Otitis media: Right ear chronically infected. Per report, has used ear dropts. Patient does not complain of worsening pain/symptoms in her ear. ",1835,680

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ ___. You were admitted for a headache and for nausea. You were found to have too much fluid in your body (heart failure) and this was causing stress to your heart. We treated you with diuretics and with medications to improve the blood flow to your heart. Your blood pressure was also found to be too high so we added a new blood pressure medication. ","Hospitalization Summary: Ms. ___ is an ___ yo ___ F with atrial fibrillation/flutter on dabigatran, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure (LVEF 60% in ___, hypertension/hyperlipidemia, and vascular dementia who presented with nausea and headache and was found to be in acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure in the setting of NSTEMI. Active Issues: #NSTEMI: Although viral infection was suspected initially on the basis of history of nausea/vomiting obtained from her sister, revised history of nausea without vomiting in the absence of sick contacts obtained from the patient via interpreter raised concern for acute coronary syndrome, with nausea representing anginal equivalent. While admission EKG was negative for acute ischemic changes, subsequent EKG on hospital day 2 demonstrated new T wave inversions in II, III, aVF, and V3-V6 in association with rising troponinemia of 0.07 to 0.11. She received 81mg aspirin x4 and atorvastatin 80mg, and home Pradaxa was held in favor of a heparin drip. She was transferred from medicine to ___ for further management. On ___, troponins peaked at 0.11 and then downtrended. MBs were flat. BNP was elevated to 3220 and it was thought the the primary pathology was CHF causing heart strain and troponin leak. Heparin gtt was discontinued after 48 hrs and dabigatran was restarted. Aspirin was increased to 325 mg qday and statin to atorvastatin 80 mg qday. #Acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure: She was found to be in acute-on-chronic heart failure on admission, with clinical signs of volume overload, moderate bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema on admission CXR, and elevated proBNP = 3220. Although transiently hypoxic with 3-L supplemental oxygen requirement in the ED, she was on room air by the time of arrival to the floor, with approximately 2-L urine output to 40mg IV Lasix in the ED. She was diuresed with 20- 40 mg IV lasix daily thereafter. She was to be discharged on ___ but had an episode of DOE while ambulating to the bathroom. CXR showed CHF and she was kept for further diuresis. Diuretic regimen on discharge was 20mg QD. She has close f/u with PCP 1 week after discharge for volume status assessment and further titration of diuretics as necessary. In addition she will be discharged with 21 hours of service and ___ with instruction for daily weights and communication with PCP if weights increase. Inactive Issues: #Atrial fibrillation/flutter: She has a history of atrial fibrillation and flutter, including recent admission for bradycardia attributed to atrial flutter with variable block. Admission EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm, and she remained in sinus rhythm on telemetry. Home dabigatran was administerd initially, but subsequently held as above in the setting of NSTEMI. Dabigatran 75 mg BID was restarted prior to discharge. #Hypertension: Home lisinopril was continued. She remained hypertensive in-house and due to multiple drug allergies, imdur 60 mg was started in addition. She continued with isolated hypertension in the very early morning but was normotensive throughout the day after medication administration so no further changes were made. #Hyperlipidemia: Home pravastatin was held in favor of atorvastatin as above. #Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Hematocrit and platelets were 33.7 and 142, respectively, on admission, consistent with recent baseline. She remained hemodynamically stable without signs of active bleeding. #Gastroesophageal reflux: Home pantoprazole was continued. Transitional Issues: - monitoring of volume status and titration of diuretic according to weights/kidney function - atorvastatin was increased to 80 mg and aspirin to 325 mg, which can be downtitrated per cardiology ",2878,881

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> An abscess is a pocket of fluid near the rectum that becomes infected. The fluid usually occurs at the site of the anal glands that we all have. The fluid can become infected and require drainage. Once they are drained, they start to feel better very quickly. Most heal completely. Thirty to fifty percent of abscesses either fail to heal over the next ___ weeks or recur at some point in your lifetime. The gland that started the infection may form a fistula, which is a small tunnel connecting the anal gland to the skin of the buttocks outside the anus. Keeping your follow-up appointment is important because it allows us to determine if you develop a fistula. Wound Care You have a malecot drain that is sutured securely on your buttocks in order to drain the abscess. This drain should be flushed every day for hygiene. The dressings that are in place may be removed the following morning or at the first bowel movement. Any packing can be removed at that time or while sitting in the tub. You should expect bloody, foul drainage for several days. This is not a sterile area, and no fancy dressings are required. Dressings mostly act to prevent staining of your undergarments. Feminine mini ___ pads may be easiest to use, and simple gauze pads are also OK. Limiting the use of tape may aid in your comfort. You should begin warm soaks in the bathtub ___ tub after you remove the packing. These soaks may be helpful at relaxing the anal muscle spasms and thus decrease your pain. They may be done for ___ minutes at a time up to every four hours, but at least twice per day. The warm soaks also allow for irrigation of the abscess cavity, which will help speed healing. When in the tub, gentle finger pressure can be applied to the skin around the abscess opening to make sure that it is still completely drained. Cleansing after bowel movements must be performed gently. Baby wipes can be helpful at getting clean with little trauma. Flushable adult wipes are also available. Avoid any medicated wipes as these may contain witch ___ or alcohol. They will cause discomfort. Wiping can be avoided all together if one goes directly to the warm soaks after a bowel movement. Nothing needs to be added to the water. Bubbles, oils, or Epsom salts may be added if this improves your comfort or sense of cleaning. The water should not be so hot as to risk a burn injury. Bowel Regimen It is often difficult to move your bowels after anal surgery. Pain and narcotic pain medications are constipating. It is important to keep the bowels moving. The stool only becomes harder if you do not move them for days. You should eat a regular healthy diet. You should take an over-the counter stool softener (Colace [sodium docusate] 100 mg twice daily or Surfak [docusate calcium] 240 mg once daily) to keep the stools soft. It must be taken with ___ glasses of liquid throughout the day. You should also take one teaspoon dose of a fiber supplement (psyllium, Metamucil, Citrucel, Benefiber) daily to keep the bowels soft and moving. Fluids are also required for these to help. Gentle stimulant laxatives (milk of magnesia, dulcolax, senna) should be taken only if you have not moved your bowels for one or two days. At times, all three of these (stool softener, fiber, and laxative) may be required to help the bowels. It is important not to take so much that you have diarrhea. Activity No driving or working until off narcotic pain medications. Otherwise, you may return to work when you feel that you are able. Avoid activity that can cause direct trauma to the area. Your activity is limited mostly by your discomfort. Pain Medication Pain should improve every day after the drainage of the abscess. No pains should be getting worse. Increased pain at the time of bowel movements is expected. Pain can be controlled with Tylenol, ibuprofen, or a prescription pain medication. No topical ointments or topical antibiotics are required. If you were given a prescription for antibiotic pills, please take them as directed. NOTIFY THE DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR: Fever greater than 101 degrees, swelling in the area, or increased pain, as these can be signs of infection. Heavy drainage is common from these wounds. Inability to move your bowels despite the previous laxative recommendation Inability to urinate. Pain and surgery can make it hard to void. Sometimes sitting in warm soaks helps to get started. Heavy bleeding. ","On ___, Mr. ___ underwent an I & D of his perirectal abscess in the OR under general anesthesia.

Found to have symptomatic UTI which was a like contributor as well as pain/trauma from her fall. She was started on antibiotics and improved back to baseline. # Small left frontal traumatic SAH: Sustained in her fall. She had repeat head CT that showed stability. She was evaluated by neurosurgery who felt no surgical intervention was needed. Her home aspirin and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin were started on ___. Her goal blood pressure was under 160 and was maintained throughout her hospitalization. Per neurosurgery she did not need seizure prophylaxis and did not need neurosurgery follow up as an outpatient. Sutures were placed for her head laceration and can be removed on ___. # T12 compression fracture # L1 transverse fracture: Per orthospine, likely chronic and unrelated to recent fall. She worked with ___ who recommended rehab. She is weight bearing as tolerated and ROM as tolerated. She should follow up with spine clinic 2 weeks after discharge. Pain control was with lidocaine patch and Tylenol. Her home tramadol was restarted on discharge at reduced dose. # Fall: She suffered an unwitnessed fall and had poor memory of the event. She is on a number of medications that could pre-dispose to falls including multiple antihypertensives (and had positive orthostatics in-house) and sedating/pain mediations.

Secondary Diagnoses: -------------------- Coronary Artery Disease Chronic Systolic Heart Failure Hypertension <DISCHARGE CONDITION> Good, tolerating PO's, with asymptomatic anemia and Hct stable >24 hours. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were admitted to the hospital because you were bleeding into your gastrointestinal tract so that blood was showing up in your colostomy bag. The GI specialists passed a camera into your stomach (endoscopy) and saw some irritation of the lining of your stomach called gastritis. We will medically manage this by giving you the acid blocking medicine (proton pump inhibitor) and by decreasing the number of medications you are on that encourage bleeding. You will follow up in the GI clinic as well. As your blood counts were stable we are now discharging you to complete your recovery at home. Your medications have been changed. Your CLOPIDOGREL (PLAVIX) has been stopped; this was discussed with your cardiologist who agreed; as you are now far enough out from your stent placement that this medication is not necessary. You have also been started on the proton pump inhibitor for blocking stomach acid. This medication is called PANTOPRAZOLE (PROTONIX). Please continue to take all other medications as prescribed. We recommend you avoid alcohol for the next few weeks as your stomach lining heals. Please keep all scheduled follow-up appointments as these are important to help manage your health. You will also need to have your INR rechecked next week as you were off this medication in the hospital and your dose will need to be re-titrated. Please call your doctor or go to the Emergency Room if you have fever>101, chest pain, shortness of breath, further black or red material in your ostomy bag, intractable nausea/vomiting, lightheadedness, fainting, or other concerning changes to your health. Regarding your heart failure, you should weigh yourself every morning and contact your doctor if your weight changes > 3 lbs over the course of 24 hours. Please limit your salt intake to 2 gms/day. ","___ yo man with chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CAD s/p stents on plavix and aspirin, and history of rectal cancer s/p resection and ostomy reconstruction, presents with anemia and dark stools. 1) Anemia/GI bleed: On presentation the patient was anemic with melena, but he was hemodynamically stable and relatively asymptomatic. Hematocrit on presentation was 26.1 so he was not immediately transfused, but he did have large bore IV's inserted and received fluid boluses. He was also started on BID PPI therapy and his anticoagulants (aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin) were held. His second hematocrit had dropped to 23.3, but as there was not a great deal of stool or blood in his ostomy bag this was presumed to be more consistent with dilution than continued brisk bleeding. Still, at that time transfusion was offered, but the patient was quite reluctant and as he continued to be hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic transfusion was held. As the day progressed hematocrit rose back to 25 and remained stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization. Gastroenterology was consulted on the day after presentation and planned to take the patient for EGD after allowing the INR to fall for a day. Unfortunately, the INR remained elevated, but at that point gastroenterology elected to proceed with EGD with a plan not to do any interventions unless their was overt, active bleeding. On EGD the patient had gastritis and duodenitis but no ulcers or obvious other sources of bleeding. ___, no intervention was performed and the patient was discharged on BID PPI and with a reduced anticoagulant regimen to follow up in GI clinic. Stools at discharge were non-melenic. Hematocrit was greater than 25. 2) CAD s/p BMS ___: The patient has history of coronary artery disease and had bare metal stents placed in ___. Nevertheless, he never had chest pain or other signs of active ischemia. His aspirin and clopidogrel were held on presentation due to concern for active bleeding. At discharge he was restarted on warfarin and aspirin but as it was greater than one year out from his stent placement it was considered safe to hold clopidogrel at discharge in order to decrease the number of anticoagulants the patient was taking. The patient's cardiologist, Dr ___, was made aware of this decision and thought it was reasonable. 3)Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has an EF of 35% by previous echocardiograms but never showed signs of acute volume overload or evidenced dyspnea in the hospital. Initially, his aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretic were held in the context of potentially active bleeding and concern about hemodynamic stability. These were all restarted prior to discharge. 4)HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension but was never frankly hypertensive in the hospital. His anti-hypertensives were initially held in the hospital and then restarted as described in the previous problem point. 5)Chronic atrial fibrillation: The patient is on metoprolol for rate control and warfarin for stroke prevention. His rate remained relatively well controlled even when metoprolol was being held. His warfarin was held on presentation but restarted after his procedure. His INR never became subtherapeutic. He will follow up with his PCP for further INR monitoring. As the patient was systemically anticoagulated no further DVT prophylaxis was given. He was on BID PPI for GI bleed. He tolerated a full diet prior to discharge. He was full code. ",2024,790

You were found to have anemia (low number of read blood cells) and worsening heart failure. We suspected bleeding from the intestine. You underwent upper endoscopy which did not demonstrate a source of bleeding in the upper part of your intestinal tract. You will need to undergo lower endoscopy (colonoscopy) to look for bleeding from the lower intestine. You were treated with medication to increase the amount of urine and decrease the accumulation of fluid in your body. You were also given blood units to treat your anemia. . The following changes were made to your medications: . # Omeprazole 40 mg tablet was changed to omeprazole 20 mg tablet. Please take one tablet ONCE daily. . # Iron 325mg tablet was added. Please take one tablet once daily. Please take with vitamin C and colace/senna stool softeners to avoid constipation. . Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

On admission found to have microcytic anemia with Hct 24.7 and Retic. Index of 1.1%. Thought to be multifactorial d/t iron deficiency, CRF, Chronic disease. Concern for hemolysis was also raised (See ""Jaundice"" below). B12 and Folate were not deficient. Iron was low with Ferrittin at low end of normal range. He was hemodynamically stable throught his stay. Despite guiac negative stools history was concerning for potential sources of GI bleed including s/p UGIB from duodenal ectasia and s/p rectal cancer. He underwent EGD which was normal. The patient declined colonoscopy at this time. Celiac serology was negative. He recieved a total of 3 units of PRBC. Hct at discharge was 30.4 His coumadin was continued as he did not have signs of major bleeding. Omeprazole dose was reduced from 40mg BID to 20mg QD per normal EGD. Iron supplementation was started. He will require close monitoring of his Hct in the out-patient setting and further anemia workup including outpatient colonoscopy, UPEP, SPEP as well as hematology consultation for possible hemolysis. . # CHF exacerbation. Mr. ___ has dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 40% per echo ___. He was clinically fluid overoladed on admission, likely ___ to decompensated HF in the setting of anemia.

He had good urine output with this and his fluid status significantly improved to euvolumia at discharge. He will continue to follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist. . # Jaundice: The patient was noticed to be Jaundiced and was found to have hyperbilirubinemia. Urobiilnogen + spoke against obstructive process. Raised LDH++ was concerning for hemolysis, but haptoglobin was normal and direct and indirect coombs testing was negative, no schistocytes were noted on smear. He does have chronic transamintis which is thought to be due to congested liver ___ to right heart failure. Worsening of liver congestion in the setting of decompensated heart failure may be the underlying cause of Jaundice. ___ syndrome is unlikely as he has no history of prior episodes of Jaundice. Trending of LFT's and further work-up should continue in the out-patient setting. Hematology consultation was arranged for work-up of possible hemolysis. . # Acute on chronic renal failure: Admission Cr 1.7 up from 1.3 at baseline, likely pre-renal failure in the setting of decompensated heart failure. Cr subsequently trended down to base-line with treatment of HF. Renal functions should be followed up in the out-patient setting. # Fever: Mr. ___ had a ___ temprature spike during a blood transfusion. Work-up for transfusion reaction was not concerning. Blood cultures were so far negative. He did have a cough but CXR was not concerning for pneumonia. UA was negative. He subsequently remained afebrile and had no leukocytosis. . # Atrial Fibrillation: patient is paced by dual chamber ICD. Rate control with BB and anticoagulatation with Warfaine were continued. His INR on discharge was 1.7. He will continue INR monitoring and warfarin dose adjustment in the out-patient setting. . # CAD: Patient is s/p stenting of the OM in ___ following cardiac arrest; His home medication regimen does not include aspirin and statin.

You received another bronchoscopy on ___, which did not show any obvious source of bleeding. Afterwards, you had a fast breathing rate and low oxygen saturation, so you were monitored in the ICU. You received antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and were on a ventilator machine at night. Your breathing and overall status has improved, and you can be discharged to your rehab in order to begin regaining your strength. You were found to have an antibody against heparin products and should avoid getting any further heparin products. The following changes were made to your medications: New: Levofloxacin 750mg daily, for 2 more days (dose on ___ and ___ Discontinued: Fluconazole, Heparin Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

Of note, he had lengthy TICU hospitalization for L ___ rib fractures, R ___ rib fractures, a L hemothorax, a L dist clavicle fracture, and he is s/p trach and peg. . # Hemoptysis: Mr. ___ was noted to have blood tinged secretions via his trach. An OSH bronschoscopy was performed and reportedly saw bleeding inside the trachea with poor visualization. He was transfused 2 units of pRBC and transferred to ___. Here, he reported no resp distress. He is status post bronchoscopy with our pulmonary team on ___, which did not find an etiology of the bleed. Only suction trauma was seen, and this may be the primary etiology of his bloody tracheal secretions. While the cause of his hemoptysis remains uncertain, his hematocrits have remained stable and there are no signs of continuing hemoptysis or active bleeding. Chemical DVT ppx was held at time of discharge after he was HIT positive and given risk of bleeding with suction trauma. . # Respiratory distress: His respiratory distress has currentlyimproved. Post bronchoscopy, he was noted to be mildly tachypnic with RR ___ and was 88% on 15L NC. A CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema, and he received lasix with improvement in PACU. He was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. Of note, he was receiving intermittent lasix and an IVF bolus prior to bronchoscopy. He is typically on 50% FIO2 with his trach mask. He was weaned from the ventilator, and was continued on albuterol MDIs. He was also treated with vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP, until his sputum Cx grew coag-positive staph sensitive to levofloxacin. He was started on an 8-day course of levofloxacin 750mg qday, of which the last dose will be on ___. Lasix 40mg PO daily was restarted on day of discharge. This should be titrated as needed. -We recommend keeping the patient on the ventilator (MMV) overnight to decrease his work of breathing. . # Fever: The patient p/w low grade fever/temperature post bronchoscopy. His fever curve was trended, and cultures were sent. His urine and blood cultures showed no growth, while his sputum culture grew coag-positive staph as mentioned above. He was continued on levofloxacin. . # Anemia: His anemia was stable after 2u pRBC prior to transfer, and his hematocrits remained stable. There was no further need for transfusion. . # Asymetric swelling of LUE: His LUE was cooler than the RUE and more swollen than the right, but still had good pulses.

The swelling appears to have reduced, although it still remains more swollen than the RUE. . # Acute on chronic systolic CHF (40-45%): The initial physical exam showed leg edema and his chest x-ray suggest mild CHF. He was given 20mg of lasix in the PACU, and further diuresis was not undertaken in the ICU. He was started on Lasix 40mg PO daily (Previous home dose) on day of discharge. This should continue to be monitored. He was given free water flushes through his G tube for hypernatremia, which resolved during his stay. . # Low platelet count: His platelets fell from 273 on admission to 107 prior to discharge. This drop was consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, for which his heparin was discontinued. This was confirmed as his heparin antibody from ___ was positive. His PLT count on ___ is 111. He was put on pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis given risk of bleeding with suction. -He should not be given heparin. . # Hypernatremia: As above, he was given free water flushes for correction of his hypernatremia, which appears to have resolved. Free water flushes were continued at time of discharge. . # Oral candidiasis: PO fluconazole was stopped prior to discharge. .

","Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with h/o CAD s/p stenting, systolic CHF (EF40-45%), atrial fibrillation, h/o cardiac arrest with heart block s/p AICD/pacemaker, trach/PEG, and recent ICU admission with GI bleed, hematuria, and MRSA bacteremia, who presented from rehab with fevers and persistent MRSA bacteremia while on vancomycin. #. MRSA Bacteremia: The source of the patient's persistent bacteremia was not found. He grew MRSA from multiple blood cultures at rehab and also on initial presentation despite appropriate vancomycin troughs. Multiple sources of persistent seeding were considered. He had a TTE and TEE which were both negative for vegetations and did not show any involvement of his pacer leads. A tagged WBC scan was performed to look for occult focus of infection which was negative. An upper extremity ultrasound was also performed to look for possible infected clot but was negative. His PICC line which had been recently replaced at ___ was removed. A new one was not placed until he had negative blood cultures. He was continued on vancomycin and dosing was changed to 1g q48h. Further blood cultures were negative. Ultimately it was felt he likely has an endovascular source but it was not found during this hospitalization. He should be continued on IV vancomycin for 6 weeks from the date of his last positive blood culture, with last day ___. #. Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI: Given that he has an indwelling foley it was suspected that this might be colonization however his cultures were positive even after changing his foley. He was found to have pseudomonas in his urine as well as wound culture. It was multidrug resistant pseudomonas and he was treated with tobramycin for a seven day course. He needs one more dose of tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when trough < 1. He also grew multidrug resistant klebsiella in his urine and was started on a 7 day course of cefepime with last day ___. #. Fevers: He had fevers on admission felt to be related to his MRSA bacteremia. Other cultures returned positive as above. He also had a knee arthrocentesis which was not consistent with septic arthritis. His PICC was changed after a 24 hour line holiday. He was ruled out for C diff. #. Acute renal failure: BUN/creatinine elevated to 70/1.7 on admission felt to be related to ongoing infection and poor forward floor from chronic systolic CHF. His creatinine slowly improved with diuresis. #. Chronic respiratory failure: He was continued on mechanical ventilation during this admission and was unable to be weaned to trach mask for any length of time. This was felt to be related to chronic respiratory fatigue in addition to substantial pulmonary edema. Diuresis was difficult due to his large obligate fluid intake, but was eventually acheived with lasix 80mg IV q6h plus metolazone 2.5mg po bid. His metolazone may need to be decreased over the next several days if he is overdiuresed as he was on average 1L negative on this regimen for the few days prior to discharge. On the day of discharge, he was on pressure support ___, PEEP 5, FiO2 50% with TV in the 300's. #. Anemia: His hematocrit remained stable in the low 20's during this admission. #. Chronic Diastolic CHF: Has EF 55%. He was continued on his home carvedilol. His lisinopril has been on hold indefinitely and was not restarted due to renal failure. He was diuresed with IV lasix and metolazone as above and will need his creatinine and electrolytes monitored closely with ongoing diuresis. #. Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage IV. He was started on a fentanyl patch and continued on prn oxycodone for pain control. #. Atrial fibrillation: His heart rate and blood pressure remained stable during this admission. He is off anticoagulation due to h/o GI bleeding and hemothorax. He was continued on carvedilol. #. Wound care: He was evaluated by the wound care team who recommended the following: 1. Follow pressure ulcer guidelines. First Step for fluid management. Turn q 2 hours. 2. Cleanse wounds with commercial wound cleanser. Pat dry. 3. Apply Aquacel ag to sacrum wound, cover with 4x4's and soft sorb dressing, secure with Medipore tape. Change daily. 4. BLE ulcerations - cover with Adaptic dressing, place 4x4 and wrap with Kerlix. Secure with paper tape. 5. No tape on skin. 6. Mid upper back ulcer - Apply Mepilex 4x4 and change q3 days. 7. Mid lower back ulcer - apply DuoDerm wound gel to bed to assist with autolytic debridement of yellow slough. Cover with Mepilex 4x4 dressing, and change q 3 days. 8. Apply Critic Aid clear skin barrier ointment to scrotal tissue to protect from fluid exposure daily. Elevate scrotum to assess with edema. 9. Waffles bilateral feet. 10. Apply aloe vesta ointment to dry intact skin daily. 11. Support nutrition and hydration. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Monitor I/O's closely and check electrolytes closely given large doses of lasix and metolazone. ___ need to back off on metalazone if signs of overdiuresis. However, would continue to aim for -500cc daily I/O balance. - Needs tobramycin trough drawn ___ AM. Give tobramycin 320mg IV x 1 when trough is <1.0. - Continue vancomycin until ___ for MRSA bacteremia. Should have trough measured intermittently to assess for appropriate dosing. - Needs 2 more days of cefepime treatment - Continue ventilator weaning and trach collar trials if possible. Diuresis should help with this. - Please draw weekly labs: CBC/diff, chem-7, LFTs and fax to Infectious disease R.Ns. at ___. All questions regarding outpatient antibiotics should be directed to the infectious disease R.Ns. at ___ or to on call MD in when clinic is closed ",4374,1393

As you know, the blood stream infection is probably chronic and it would basically be impossible to cure of you that. We believe that your pacemaker is colonized with the bacteria, and it would be impossible to remove it. You also have a urinary tract infection, and you were bleeding somewhere in your intestines. Fortunately the bleeding stopped. You also have a chronic heart failure, which you are aware. Your kidney insufficiency may resolve, but it may not. You were also administered the flu vaccine while you were here. ","___ male with extensive cardiac PMH, recent MRSA bacteremia, trach on chronic mechanical ventilation, and chronic foley catheter with recent pseudomonal/klebsiella UTI, who presents now from rehab with fever, leukocytosis, vomiting, and AMS in setting enterococcus and yeast UTI, ___, MRSA bacteremia, hematochezia, and Stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer. . ACUTE ISSUES #. MRSA Bacteremia: Pt had recurrent MRSA bacteremia in the settting of vancomycin treatment. We are particularly concerned about endocarditis from ICD given the refractory nature. However, removal of instrumentation is not an option per patietn and family wishes. Source of infection include sacral decubitous ulcer, UTI, ventilation. Pt does not have leukocytosis or fever. Chronic colonization likely. Complete bacterial clearance is unlikely in this setting. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - START Daptomycin indefinitely - PICC line in place, routine care . #. GIB: Pt presented with HCT drop and Bright red blood through ostomy. He received a total of 3 units pRBC blood transfusion. We temporarily stopped tube feeding the setting of GIB, and discontinued his aspirin. His HCT has been stable in the past 48 hours without transfusion. GI has been consulted, and did not feel that the benefit of osteostomy-scope outweighs its risk. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - CONTINUE tube feeding as scheduled - STOP aspirin and anti-platelets forever. - START pantoprazole 40 mg iv bid - CONTINUE ferrous sulfate, sucrafate . #. ___: Pt presented with elevated Cr to 3.5 on admission with anuria. There was muddy brown cast on urine sedimentation, concerning for ATN in the setting of sepsis and tobramycin exposure. We gave him gentle fluid challenge, and his urine output recovered shortly afterwards. His creatinine decreased to 2.7 on the day of discharge. This may or may not ever go back down to his previous baseline. Regardless, he's not anuric and patient and family have refused initiation of dialysis. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - AVOID nephrotoxic medication - DISCONTINUE Lisinopril . #. Hematuria and UTI: Pt has indwelling foley catheter and presented with hematuria and positive UA. Urine culture was notable for VRE, fungus. We treated him with meropenem and fluconazole while he was in the MICU. He received bladder irrigation for hematuria. His hematuria resolved on the day of discharge. Pt was asymptomatic from his UTI. We felt it is impossible to completely treat his UTI. We decided to withdrawal treatment for now to minimize the hepatic and renal drug intoxication. . #. Decubitus ulcer: Pt has a Stage 4 decubitus ulcer over sacrum and left thigh. The pain from decubitous ulcer is his major concern while he was here. He was seen by wound care. They advise supportive care. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - Pleae CHANGE BODY POSITION every 2 hours - Please provide adequate pain management with lidocaine patch, fentanyl, oxycodone. . #. Positive sputum culture: Pt has trach tube. His sputum culture grew multiresistant klebsiella and pseudomonas. Pt remained afebrile, no leukocytosis, left shift or increased sputum production. We felt the complete irradiation was unlikey given his current clinical status and suspect he has permanent colonization. . CHRONIC ISSUES #. Chronic dCHF: Pt has diastolic CHF. We continued his beta-blocker for the need of rate control. We held his lisinopril in an hope of protecting his current kidney function. We held his aspirin in the setting of GI bleeding. We felt that active treatment for his CHF is less of a priority. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - DISCONTINUED Aspirin and all antiplatelet drugs - DISCONTINUED Lisinopril . #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt is AV paced on telemetry. Not on anticoagulation given history of GI bleeding. Rate controlled with carvedilol. OUTPATIENT ISSUES - Per our EP recommendation, they can disable the defibrillator function, while still keep AV pacing, if there is a need in the change of goal of care. . # Depression: Continue citalopram. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Pt declared a code status of DNR/DNI. Extensive discussion has occurred between family and care provider team on goal of care. In general, our understanding is that family would like continued conservative treatment, with no invasive procedure, including the use of pressors. We have conveyed clearly to the family that clinical improvement is unlikely in the current situation. Pt's family expressed concerns that patient has not been getting enough comfort care (ie skin, wound, pain). . The wife has expressed continued frustration with being transferred back and forth from rehab to the hospital. We assured her that the care provided to him at rehab is very good. In general, we'd try to limit the number of unecessary hospitalizations. We explained to the family, with the son present in the room, that the patient's condition is stable, but ultimately is declining. We explicity told them that things are probably as good as they'll ever be, and that in the future he will have a slow and steady decline. We are limited in interventions that can be done here in hospital and have conveyed that to his family. . . ",3997,1183

In ___ was admitted to ___ for PNA and found to have MRSa bacteremia. Was dicharged on Vancomycin. Was readmitted later that month for a GI bleed. ___ was deferred ___ to family wishes and comorbidites. He was discharged again to ___. Surveilece cultures remained positive and he was readmitted for infectious work up. TTE, TEE and tagged WBC scan were all negative for ocult infectious source. On that admission he was diagnosed with concurrent Pseudomonas and Klebsiella UTI and treated with Meropenam. Given his persistent MRSA bacteremia he was switched from Vancomycin to daptomycin. . Over the last several days he has been febrile with intermittent AMS. Blood cultures are persistently positive. Per notes form his PCP and discussions with the family, he is being admitted for evaluation for ICD lead explantation and for managment of fevers. . With regards to the bleedign at the G-tube site, the nursing staff at the rehabilitation facility noted oozing of blood from around the G-tube site. There was no bleeding at the lumen of the site.

These were treated with IV vancomycin and meropenem. He subsequently developed bleeding at his G-tube site as well as increased dark output from ostomy bag. His hct trend was: 30 (___) -> 28 (___) -> 25 (___) -> 22 (___). He was transfused 1 unit pRBC. Hct ___ was 18 and bleeding persisted. GI and surgery were consulted. He was given reglan, and started on ppi iv bid. GI performed 3 EGDs that large amounts of blood and an ulcer with visible vessel around peg insertion site; An initial attempt at clipping the ulcer caused bright red blood, confirming that this was likely the cause of the patient's recent bleed. 10cc of epinephrine were injected around the ulcer. 2 clips were applied around the ulcer with hemostasis successfully achieved. The PEG was removed. Because of his chronic MRSA bacteremia (thought likely ___ ICD seeding), TPN was not an option and family felt that a feeding tube would cause him too much discomfort. The palliative care team was consulted for assistance with the family's decision-making regarding goals of care. The family ultimately felt that his current quality of life was not consistent with what he would have wanted based on remarks he had made in the past. They elected to change his goals of care to comfort-measures only. On HD#9 he passed away with family at bedside. Family declined autopsy. ",2539,405

You were admitted to the hospital because you had seizures. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL? Your seizures were controlled with medication. You were found to have abdominal pain caused by inflammation in your gallbladder and pancreas. Your gallbladder was removed and this helped the inflammation. We think that your seizures were caused by the inflammation in your gallbladder and pancreas. You were also found to have hypertension caused by a partial blockage to the artery for your right kidney. You were started on new medications to treat your blood pressure and your blood pressure improved. WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AT HOME? You should continue the new medications for your seizures and blood pressure and follow up with the surgeons and neurologist at your next scheduled appointment. You also have a primary care physician appointment scheduled for you to follow up and establish care. You will have to discuss with the new PCP about cardiologist referral for your peripheral vascular disease that was treated with aspirin, Plavix, and procedures in your lower extremity arteries in ___ last year. As you know, your Plavix was stopped due to GI bleeding that occurred in ___ last year. You need a new cardiologist to continue to manage your antiplatelet agents. Because you had a seizure, please do not drive a car until you are cleared by your Neurologist. Please work on switching your insurance to ___ so that you can continue to get care here. Thank you for allowing us be involved in your care, we wish you all the best! Your ___ Team ","================ PATIENT SUMMARY: ================ ___ year old woman who presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizure in the setting of gallstone pancreatitis who was found to have right side renal artery stenosis. Seizures were controlled with keppra and patient underwent cholecystectomy and patients blood pressure was well controlled with medical management. ============= ACUTE ISSUES: ============= #Generalized tonic clonic seizures: Patient presented after a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. She presented to the emergency room and seizures were initially controlled with ativan in the emergency room. Neurology followed the patient during this hospitalization for workup of seizures. Patient was found to have gallstone induced pancreatitis which is believed to have caused seizures in a patient with underlying susceptibility given history of CVA. She underwent cholecystectomy. Infectious workup was negative. LP was preformed which was bland. MRI demonstrated existing infarcts, but no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial process. The patient was maintained on Keppra 1500 BID and had no further seizures during hospitalization. Neurology recommends that the patient continue keppra 1500 BID indefinitely until potential modification by outpatient neurology in 6 months. If there is concern for mild encephalopathy and gait unsteadiness, Keppra could be decreased to 1250 mg twice daily prior to follow-up. She was started on atorvastatin and aspirin for primary prevention of CVA. #Renal artery stenosis: Patient was found to have right sided renal artery stenosis on CT during hospitalization. Systolic blood pressure were initially 170 systolic. Her blood pressure was controlled with nicardipine drip. Vascular surgery evaluated the patient and recommended no surgical intervention. She was medically managed with oral antihypertensive regime and blood pressure was successfully controlled to the 100-160s systolic. she should continue lisinopril, amlodapine and labetalol as an outpatient. #Gallstone pancreatitis Patient was found to have choledocolithiasis induced pancreatitis. She underwent cholecystectomy and had an uneventful postoperative course. Pain was well controlled with oral oxycodone in the postoperative period. The patient will follow with acute care surgery two weeks after discharge. =============== CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== #GERD: Home famotidine was continued ==================== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== [ ] Please recheck patient blood pressure and adjust blood pressure medications accordingly as an outpatient [ ] Neurology recommends that the patient continue keppra 1500 BID indefinitely until potential modification by outpatient neurology in 6 months.

WHY DID YOU COME TO THE HOSPITAL? -You felt lightheaded and suffered a fall WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU DURING YOUR HOSPITAL STAY? -You were given blood to increase your blood counts -Your bloody bowel movements were evaluated and treated by the gastroenterologists -You were evaluated for seizures by the neurologists and was started on a medication to prevent seizures -You were found to have severe blockages in both arteries supplying blood to brain and need to follow-up with the vascular surgeons in vascular surgery clinic to discuss surgical correction of these blockages -Your heart was evaluated by the cardiologists who do not recommend any further testing at this time WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? please take all of your medications as prescribed, details below Please keep all of your appointments as scheduled -Please keep track of whether you have passed the capsule in your bowel movement. If you have not passed the capsule in 2 days since discharge, you should be seen in clinic by your PCP. Please call your PCP right away if you have any symptoms such as constipation, vomiting, anorexia, and if you are not passing any gas. We wish you the very best! Your ___ Care Team ","___ with history of CVA, seizures, upper GI AVM's with chronic anemia, HTN, peripheral vasculopathy, who presented after presyncopal fall. ACUTE ISSUES ============ # Acute on Chronic Blood Loss Anemia # Upper GI Bleed Presented with ongoing intermittent melena and known gastric and duodenal AVMs per prior EGD's s/p single balloon enteroscopy with APC to small bowel AVMs. Stool guaiac positive in ___. Required 2u pRBCs during her hospitalization. EGD showed several duodenal/gastric AVMs that were cauterized, as well as likely ___ esophagus. Patient was iron deficient and was given 2 125mg IV infusions of ferric gluconate. Patient was continued on PPI prophylaxis. # Seizures Patient reported that her last seizure 1 week prior to admission and involved extremity shaking and AMS that lasted several minutes, consistent with previous episodes. Neurology was consulted for optimization of her AEDs. EEG was performed and the patient was continued on Keppra with plans for outpatient followup in neurology clinic. She had no seizures in house. # Severe, Bilateral Carotid Artery Stenosis Carotid US done as part of pre-syncope work-up revealed severe bilateral carotid artery stenosis (80-99%). She was seen by vascular surgery in house, who recommended no urgent treatment. This could certainly contribute to pre-syncope, however vascular surgery will followup with patient for CEA consideration. # Presyncope Presented 4 days after presyncopal episode at home with fall and head trauma. CT head and c-spine were negative at OSH. Signs and symptoms not consistent with prior seizures. Initial ddx included CNS process (TIA, carotid stenosis), cardiac (had old RBBB on EKG, and new LBBB on this admission), orthostasis (had previously documented orthostatic hypotension), vasovagal event, peripheral vertigo (has tinnitus), or symptomatic anemia. # Concern for Cardiac Conduction Disease Noted patient has HRs usually in ___, even when standing and lightheaded. There was concern that she was not adequately augmenting her cardiac output with exertion due to conduction disease and this blunted response was contributing to her pre-syncope. Also noted to initially have RBBB on EKG, but then LBBB on EKG done later in the same day (in ___ on presentation). Unusual and concerning for conduction disease, so cardiology was consulted and beta-blocker (home med) was held. pMIBI revealed no overt ischemia and ambulatory telemetry revealed that patients heart rates increased to ___. Cardiology felt that this was an appropriate response and the patient did not require further electrophysiologic evaluation during this hospitalization. # Hypertension Patient has history of hypertension (renal artery stenosis) with orthostatic hypotension. Antihypertensives were held in the setting of GI bleed but were restarted once her GI bleed was addressed. She was continued on home doses of blood pressure medications and was also started on chlorthalidone 12.5mg daily for better control. # Chronic Back and Neck Pain Has narcotics contract w PCP for oxycodone 5mg BID since ___. Review of MassPMP indicates pt also prescribed vicodin in OSH ___ three days prior to presentation. Likely that pain is exacerbated by recent fall, so increased pain regimen while in-house. CHRONIC ISSUES ============== # Neuropathic pain: continued gabapentin 300mg TID. # GERD: continued PPI and famotidine. # Chronic nausea: continued ondansetron PRN. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== []Ensure passage of capsule, on discharge KUB ___ noted to be in sigmoid colon/rectum. Consider repeat KUB to assess if concerned.

You were admitted to the hospital with right leg pain that we found was secondary to a blockage in your bypass graft. We also noted a clot in a vein in your calf. We did a peripheral angiogram to open up the graft with special catheter and balloons. To do the procedure, a small puncture was made in one of your arteries. The puncture site heals on its own: there are no stitches to remove. You tolerated the procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the hospital. Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful recovery. Peripheral Angiography Puncture Site Care For one week: -Do not take a tub bath, go swimming or use a Jacuzzi or hot tub. -Use only mild soap and water to gently clean the area around the puncture site. -Gently pat the puncture site dry after showering. -Do not use powders, lotions, or ointments in the area of the puncture site. You may remove the bandage and shower the day after the procedure. You may leave the bandage off. You may have a small bruise around the puncture site. This is normal and will go away one-two weeks. Activity For the first 48 hours: -Do not drive for 48 hours after the procedure For the first week: -Do not lift, push , pull or carry anything heavier than 10 pounds -Do not do any exercises or activity that causes you to hold your breath or bear down with abdominal muscles. Take care not to put strain on your abdominal muscles when coughing, sneezing, or moving your bowels. After one week: -You may go back to all your regular activities, including sexual activity. We suggest you begin your exercise program at half of your usual routine for the first few days. You may then gradually work back to your full routine. Medications: Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all the medicine you should take at home. If a medication that you normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not take is on the list please discuss it with the team! ","___ sp Rt AK pop to ___ bypass with NRGSV ___ for arterial thrombosis presents with worsening right leg pain that occurred over predictable distances and acute change over past 24 hours with fullness in her right leg. Her motor and sensation are intact with no signs of limb threat. A heparin infusion was started. Arterial duplex showed occluded right popliteal to posterior tibial artery bypass. She was taken to the OR for right lower extremity angiogram, angioJet mechanical thrombectomy of occluded bypass graft, balloon angioplasty of outflow stenosis. A tpa catheter was left in place overnight. She return the next day for right lower extremity angiogram, angioJet mechanical thrombectomy of occluded bypass graft and balloon angioplasty of outflow stenosis. At that session, we were able to remove residual thrombus in the native right popliteal artery and bypass with good outflow to the foot via the anterior tibial, and peroneal arteries. At this point she was pain free with a palpable graft AT and DP pulse. The next morning, we discontinued the heparin infusion and started xarelto. She was ambulatory ad lib, voiding qs and tolerating a regular diet. She was discharged to home. We will see her again in followup in one month with surveillance duplex. ",1597,286

The patient is ___ mild pulmonary edema. ___ addition, there is a rounded opacity at the lateral and lower aspect 's of the right hilus, potentially representing atelectasis. However, short term radiographic followup should be performed to exclude developing pneumonia or aspiration. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ___: IMPRESSION: All of the pulmonary abnormalities could be due to atelectasis bilateral lower lobe, including collapse without bronchial obstruction. Lesions ___ the posterior segment of the right upper lobe and particularly the lingula should be re-evaluated with chest CT, contrast enhanced if clinically feasible, when aeration improves elsewhere. Pulmonary hypertension. Cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___: IMPRESSION: 1. Comparison across modalities to recent MRI is difficult. However, there is no significant change since outside CT of ___. Again there is nonspecific diffuse hypodensity of the white matter. Possible hypodense area ___ the left cerebellar hemisphere. 2. Diffuse distribution is somewhat atypical for PRES although PRES can be seen ___ a non- posterior distribution. Repeat MRI may be helpful for further evaluation. 3. New aerosolized secretions ___ the sphenoid sinuses, opacification of the left mastoid air cells and fluid ___ the left middle ear cavity. Please correlate clinically for acute sinusitis. EEG ___: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of frequent blunted epileptiform discharges ___ bilateral occipital regions. These, only on rare occasions, have a high voltage sharp morphology, ___ the bilateral posterior quadrants, phase reversing ___ a broad field isoelectric at O1 and O2 or at times with shifting laterality between each posterior quadrant. At times, these occur ___ brief runs at ___ Hz lasting up to five seconds ___ the first half of the recording but do not evolve ___ frequency, morphology, or location to meet criteria for seizure. ___ the latter half of the recording, the frequency of the brief runs decrease to 0.5-0.75 Hz and predominantly have only a blunted morphology. These sharp waves indicate potentially epileptogenic foci ___ both occipital regions. Additionally, there is a continuous pattern of severe diffuse background slowing fluctuating with a discontinuous burst suppression pattern throughout the entire recording. These findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is non-specific as to etiology. The fluctuations of the continuous and discontinuous background pattern could indicate either fluctuation ___ severity of the severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction or effects of sedating medications. EKG ___: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Prior anteroseptal and lateral myocardial infarction. Slight ST segment elevation ___ leads V1-V2 with ST segment depression and T wave inversion ___ leads I and aVL. ST segment flattening and slight depression ___ leads II and aVF. The ST-T wave changes raise the question of active anterolateral ischemic process. No previous tracing available for comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested. TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___: Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen ___ the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen ___ the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. MRA MRA BRAIN/NECK W/O CONTRAST ___: IMPRESSION: Study somewhat suboptimal; circle of ___ not completely included. Allowing for technical limitations, no flow-limiting stenosis or aneurysm more than 3mm of the circle ___ or vessels of the neck. Consider repeat evaluation with better quality images when feasible. ___ EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study because of occasional blunted epileptiform discharges ___ the bilateral posterior quadrants, phase reversing ___ a broad field isoelectric at O1 and O2 or at times with shifting laterality between each posterior quadrant. On rare occasions, these discharges occur ___ brief ___ second runs at 0.25-0.5 Hz but do not evolve ___ frequency, morphology, or location to meet criteria for seizure. These blunted epileptiform discharges indicate potentially epileptogenic foci ___ both occipital regions. There is moderate to severe diffuse background slowing, which is nonspecific as to etiology. Compared to the previous days recording, the bilateral posterior quadrant epileptiform discharges have decreased ___ frequency, and there is mild improvement ___ the background. ___ CXR IMPRESSION: Examination is centered at the diaphragm, excluding the lung apices. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, but mild interstitial edema may have improved. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion along the imaged pleural surfaces. Left PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction, repositioned from the azygos vein. Feeding tube has been withdrawn to the upper stomach. The side ports may not all be beyond the gastroesophageal junction. ___ MRI (radiology read) IMPRESSION: Several acute small subcortical infarcts are identified since the previous MRI examination. There is been some decrease ___ hyperintensities ___ the basal ganglia, brainstem and cerebellum and cerebral convexity regions.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Mr. ___, You were admitted with a hypertensive urgency with blood pressures as high as 240/110. This caused nausea/vomiting and headache and damage to your brain called posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on your Brain MRI. You also had multiple small strokes scattered throughout your brain on a repeat brain MRI. You initially required intubation for trouble breathing. You were transferred to one of our ICUs from another hospital for further management after it became difficult to extubate you. On admission, you had right sided weakness that improved over time. You were ultimately extubated and could breath on your own. Your blood pressure required multiple medications for management throughout the admission but we eventually kept your blood pressure controlled between ___ on multiple blood pressure medications. You had a low red blood cell count (anemia) during the admission which we thought was likely because of the stress placed on your body (anemia of chronic disease). You had a scope of your upper and lower gut to look for other sources of bleeds but these were normal. You had a bacterial infection ___ your blood and a pneumonia that required treatment with IV Vancomycin and IV Zosyn for 12 days. Your kidneys also showed damage from your likely long standing high blood pressure. Our renal service evaluated you and a kidney biopsy was done to confirm this diagnosis. You have been evaluated by our physical therapists. They recommend discharge home with home physical therapy. ___ addition to the follow up appointments listed below, you will also require follow-up with a neurologist. Please obtain a referral from your primary care doctor. ","___ who had not sought medical attention for 25 to ___ years with h/o IVDA and alcoholism who presents with hypertensive urgency with SBP 230-250, N/V, HA, ultimately developing PRES and multiple lacunar infarcts with bleeding all thought to be ___ his hypertension. His medical course was complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure possible ___ intermittent AMS vs HTN-associated pulmonary edema, persistently difficulty to control HTN, HTN-associated CKD, and chronic anemia ultimately felt to be anemia of chronic disease. He was discharged on multiple medications for blood pressure control, ASA, and atorvastatin. Evaluation by ___ on ___: home w/ home ___ & home OT and 24hr assist from family following 0 ___ visits. Will d/c with rx for standard wheelchair. Hospital course # Neuro - At OSH - MRI/MRV was done ___ and showed no MRV abnormality but did show diffuse FLAIR hyperintensity through the cerebral white matter, brainstem (worst ___ pons) and bilateral cerebellar white matter. Repeat MRI ___ showed multiple bilateral cerebral white matter acute punctate infarcts (bright on DWI and dark on ADC) with associated GRE signal abnormality suggestive of bleed. After concern for acute stroke on MRI on ___, he was started on ASA 81 and Atorvastatin. He reportedly had R sided weakness for multiple days prior to transfer but has been sedated on a propofol drip for intubation. On arrival, he had a clear R hemiparesis and possible L facial weakness. By the time of extubation and transfer to the floor Neurology service from the MICU, these symptoms had resolved. His mental status was notable for intermittent disorientation to month, year, and location. He had multiple anxiety episodes (which reportedly occurred frequently prior to admission as well) - these episodes improved with olanzapine which wasn't required for the 24 hours prior to discharge. He was started on qHS trazodone for insomnia and night time agitation. It may be worthwhile to repeat his MRI as an outpatient for prognostication purposes, though his exam is now clearly improved. #Respiratory - Patient has been intubated 3x at OSH, each time for hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is also question of patient have altered mental status which contributed to difficulty weaning from vent and need for intubation for airway protection. He was successfully extubated after arrival to the FICU on ___. # CV - Patient with HAs, vision changes, elevated BP and CKD on admission to OSH. Patient was kept on nitro gtt, IV hydral, IV metop, clonidine and IV enalapril during hospitalization at ___ ___. Initially maintained on nitro gtt. Gradual control of BPs (given history of strokes and given likely history of chronic HTN) was achieved with SBPs ___ the 120s to 150s with clonidine 0.3 mg qDay (patch - changed qWk), carvedilol, lisinopril, and amlodipine. Clonidine can be weaned by 0.1 mg qWk over the next three weeks to off. Further HTN management will be directed by the renal service on an outpatient basis. # Renal: Patient with elevated creatinine and proteinuria on admission to OSH. Seen by nephrology at ___ who gave diagnosis of hypertensive nephropathy. Recommended BP control and initiation of Ace-inhibitor. Renal U/S at OSH was normal except for R renal cyst. Urine sediment reportedly bland. UA here unremarkable. Cr remains elevated and stable. Kidney biopsy performed ___. Preliminary results revealed endocapillary proliferation and some endothelial damage. There is evidence of chronic disease, arterial wall thickening, some GN. Most likely ___ chronic kidney disease. Creatinine 2.6 on ___ creatinine 2.8 on ___. OSH evaluation for pheo, thyroid abn, cortisol abn were unremarkable. Renin and aldosterone pending at the time of discharge. Renal dopplers limited by patient cooperation but overall unremarkable. # ID - Patient grew GPCs ___ clusters ___ 2 bottles from cultures from ___. Patient only had PIVs ___ place until ___. Vanc sensitive. TTE without evidence of vegetation. Plan for vancomycin; will need two week course starting from date of first negative blood culture (last day ___. Also on ___, was found to have CXR c/f aspiration PNA. Completed 10 day course of IV Zosyn for this. # Heme: Patient acutely developed an anemia with Hg drop from ~11 to ___ over 24 hours, but then stable afterwards. Low reticulocyte count with elevated ferritin and haptoglobin were consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Given history of positive guaics (which resolved when the patient was put on a PPI), GI was consulted. EGD/Colonoscopy were unremarkable. Any further evidence of persistently guiaic positive stools should prompt capsule study. Renal felt that chronic renal disease could be contributing to anemia but EPO would not be recommended for the patient unless his anemia was long standing and until his BP was well controlled.

You will need to continue treatment with antibiotics for a further 1 day. We also gave you medications to contorl pain and cramping. Please followup with your primary care practitioner. ","The patient is a ___ year old female with a history of GERD and prior C.diff infecion ___ years ago who presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and watery diarrhea. ACTIVE ISSUES: # Enteritis/Abdominal Pain: Most likely represents a viral enteritis given her associated URI symptoms of voice hoarseness and sinus congestion, though her recent cruise to ___ raises traveler's diarrhea as also possible but unlikely due to late presentation. Appendicitis was considered very unlikely based on imaging and prominence of diarrhea. Fortunately C-diff PCR is negative. Campylobacter and otther stool studies also negative. IBD very unlikely given the acute presentation and lack of alarm or systemic symptoms. She receivedI IV fluids, bismuth, and an empiric 3-day course of po ciprofloxacin. Her pain was managed with tylenol, opioids, and dicyclomine for cramping. She was tolerating a light diet prior to time of discharge. # Leukocytosis: Resolved after IV fluids overnight after admission. She had elevated WBC 17.6 with N 86.4% on admission. Most likely this is multifactorial from enteritis along with hypovolemia and hemoconcentration. Resolved with fluids alone without any initial empiric antibiotic coverage. CHRONIC ISSUES: # GERD: She takes Omeprazole 40 mg PO BID for GERD symptoms. Given her Cdiff history, tapering her PPI as an outpatient would be reasonable to consider. Continued Omeprazole 40 mg PO BID for now # Anxiety: Continued home fluoxetine. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - consider tapering omeprazole as outpatient if able given history of c-diiff ",3098,364

In ___ she underwent an abdominal myomectomy with left ovarian cystectomy for 27 fibroids and a 15-cm endometrioma. She reports recovering well until around ___, when she started to experience epigastric discomfort and occasional shortness of breath. She underwent CTA of the chest to evaluate for PE, which was negative and there was no lymphadenopathy or suspicious nodule seen. In ___, she got the heaviest period she has had since her Mirena IUD was placed. She underwent endometrial biopsy on ___, which showed chronic endometritis. She was already taking doxycycline for a positive Lyme titer while awaiting confirmatory testing, but continued to have vaginal bleeding. Her followup Lyme testing was negative. She continued to feel quite fatigued and noted abdominal pain epigastrically as well as in the LLQ, back pain, and decreased appetite and constipation which got progressively more bothersome during ___. She ultimately went to the ED on ___ where she underwent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed a large 10-cm left complex adnexal cystic mass with septations and irregular solid components. Additionally, there were multiple subcapsular hepatic lesions and peritoneal implants, as well as retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Findings were concerning for a metastatic primary ovarian neoplasm, such as cystadenocarcinoma, versus atypical distribution of endometriotic implants. On ___ patient underwent an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis lower thorax showed clear lung bases no focal consolidations no pleural or pericardial effusion. Liver showed multiple nonenhancing cystic subcapsular implants likely representing hemorrhage. The largest right arises from the right lobe of the liver and measured 4.1 x 2.8 cm. There was no associated enhancement likely represent adherent clot. There were no suspicious enhancing lesions intrinsic to the hepatic parenchyma. Again, in regard to the pelvis, there was a large cystic multiloculated left adnexal structure measuring up to 10.8 x 10.1 cm. The septations were thin without significant enhancement or nodular components. The loculations demonstrated fluid-filled areas correction fluid-filled levels also likely representing hemorrhage. Within one of the loculations, there was a dark spot sign a finding that could be consistent with endometriosis. A smaller right adnexal cystic structure was seen measuring 3.5 x 3.0 cm. Uterus was enlarged with multiple small fibroids and IUD was seen within the endometrial cavity at. There was a trace free fluid within the pelvis multiple cystic anterior peritoneal implants were visualized with fluid-filled levels likely representing hemorrhage. There was peripheral enhancement, which may be reactive in nature. One of these peritoneal implants appeared to have significant surrounding fat stranding. A left periaortic retroperitoneal lesion had a similar appearance. Multiple subcentimeter periaortic lymph nodes were nonspecific. There was no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. She saw Dr. ___ in the office on ___ and received a 1-month dose of Lupron. She was referred to ___ Oncology for further evaluation given atypical imaging findings. Of note, she had a CA125 checked on ___, which was 108, decreased from 209 in ___. CEA was 0.9 on ___. Today she reports abdominal bloating, constipation, decreased appetite and increased abdominal girth. She noted decreased vaginal spotting since her Lupron shot, but it has been persistent. She also reports continued fatigue and occasional nausea.

We are not clear if this is from your prior kidney cancer, or is a new cancer. However, after discussion with yourself and your daughter, it was decided to treat this with radiation, but not to pursue aggressive treatment options at this time. Please take all medications as prescribed. We have made many minor changes to your medications, and the major changes are as follows: - Changed mirtazipine to haloperidol at night to help relaxation. - Started dexamethasone, a steroid to decrease swelling in your spine. You will also take bactrim, an antibiotic, while on this medication to prevent infection. - Started lisinopril for blood pressure. - Increased lasix to 40mg daily for heart failure. - Changed metoprolol to 50mg BID for blood pressure. - Stopped your valtrex as it is unclear that this is needed. If you experience fevers, chills, worsening confusion, dizziness, chest pain, trouble breathing, back pain, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention or return to the hospital immediately. ","1. AMS: Per discussion with daughter, patient has had progressive dementia for months, although daughter was not present to comment on deviation from baseline. Her superimposed delirium and agitation were likely from benzo withdrawal, as she was not initially continued on her outpatient standing lorazepam (med list wasn't yet available). With addition of this, and 1mg PO haldol at night, she continued to be confused, although was much more calm and had no further agitation. Her delirium was also managed with pain control (she had very little pain during the admission, though) and frequent reorientation and reassurance. Infectious workup was negative. She had a brain MRI to rule out CVA or metastatic disease, and this was negative. 2. Lytic spine lesion: Seen in T5, T7, T8. Also seen was a mass surrounding the spinal cord with mild anterior spinal cord compression, although with a normal neuro exam. She underwent 3 sessions of XRT during this admission, and will continue XRT on ___ and ___ at 2pm to complete a total of 5 sessions. It remains unclear if her lesions are metastatic renal carcinoma or a new primary, as her renal cell cancer was last treated ___ years ago. CT abdomen/pelvis was done to search for a primary, or find a site amenable to biopsy as XRT made vertebral biopsy not possible. Tumor markers were also sent, but not suggestive of a specific diagnosis. After discussion with the patient's daughter ___ (to whom the patient deferred all medical decisions due to her confusion), it was decided that no further workup for a primary site would be performed. Also, it was decided that there would be no further attempts at treating the patient's malignancy at this time. The patient was on dexamethasone, along with insulin sliding scale and bactrim for prophylaxis, during this admission. She was discharged on a dexamethasone taper, and the bactrim and insulin can be stopped once she is off steroids. Please continue the taper through ___ as outlined explicitly in her discharge medication list. Taper may be modified further upon follow up with radiation-oncology. 3. Disposition: The patient is to return to her prior skilled nursing facility. Her other multiple chronic medical problems remained stable and her prior medication regimen was continued. Regarding goals of care, the patient's daughter was clear that her mother would not want aggressive cancer treatments. She will complete her current radiation course and there is no plan for further treatment of her malignancy. However, she would be amenable to rehospitalization and reconsideration of treatment options if an acute problem were to develop. Patient's code status is DNR/DNI. ",3879,564

Confluent opacification at the base of the right lung is probably atelectasis, pleural mild pneumonia is difficult to exclude. In all other locations there no findings that would raise the possibility of pneumonia. ___ ___: FINDINGS: There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation of the bilateral common femoral, proximal, mid, distal femoral, and popliteal veins. Normal color flow and compressibility are demonstrated in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins. There is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral veins bilaterally. No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst. IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilaterallower extremity veins. EKG ___: Narrow complex tachycardia. Probably sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the rate has increased. CXR ___: FINDINGS: Numerous nodular opacities compatible the patient's metastatic disease are again appreciated. In addition, there is worsening pulmonary edema as well as a worsening right lower lobe infiltrate which could represent pneumonia in the correct clinical setting. A right pleural effusion is also increased in size. IMPRESSION: Worsening combination of pleural effusion, pulmonary edema and possibly pneumonia particularly in the right lower lobe. CTA CHEST W/ CONTRAST ___: IMPRESSION: 1. Partially limited evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries, however no evidence of central, lobar, or segmental pulmonary embolism. 2. Since ___, increase in size and number of innumerable pulmonary metastases, as well as enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate on the left. 3. Partially imaged upper abdomen demonstrates diffuse intrahepatic metastasis and considerable upper abdominal lymphadenopathy. KUB ___: IMPRESSION: 1. Rectal stent overlying the sacrum. 2. No bowel obstruction. 3. Likely interval decrease of small right pleural effusion. CT ABDOMEN PELVIS W/ CONTRAST ___: IMPRESSION: 1. Interval (since ___ placement of a colonic stent, 2. Circumscribed 10.4 x 7.4mm anterior pelvic fluid collection containing small locules of gas, likely an abscess from sigmoid tumor perforation. This is amenable to drainage. 2a. Moderate/large amount of free air, and small amount of free fluid within the peritoneum. 3. Extensive lymphadenopathy in the retroperitoneum and porta hepatis, which results in narrowing of the origin of the left renal vein. Encasement of the splenic vein-SMV confluence and bilateral renal arteries is also demonstrated, without significant intraluminal narrowing in these vessels. Normally enhancing kidneys on today's study. 4. Innumerable hepatic metastases. 5. Innumerable pulmonary metastases, lungs only partially imaged. 6.

","Mr. ___ was admitted to the thoracic surgery service for a left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. He was taken to the OR and underwent an uncomplicated VATS LLL lobectomy with placement of a chest tube. He tolerated the procedure without complications and recovered uneventfully in the PACU before being transferred to the floor in stable condition. (Please see the associated operative report for specific procedural details.) Post-operatively his pain was controlled with a PCA and IV pain medication with a transition to PO pain meds once tolerating POs. His diet was advanced slowly and without difficulty. His chest tube was removed on POD#2 without incident and his oxygen saturations were > 95% on room air. He was able to use his incentive spirometer effectively. Unfortunately he failed one voiding trial which required replacement of his Foley catheter for an additional day. His second voiding trial was successful and Flomax was also started. He had some confusion with the use of Dilaudid but improved with Ultram and Tylenol. Upon standing up for a chest xray he had some dizziness and orthostatic signs were checked. Lying, his BP was 114/70 with a heart rate of 78 and standing it was 80/42 with a heart rate of 88. He was initially treated with IV fluids and increasing his oral intake of liquids. Despite doing that his orthostasis persisted and an EKG demonstrated atrial fibrillation at a rate of 114. This was also associated with hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia. After repleting his electrolytes and starting metoprolol, he converted back into sinus rhythm. Of note, he had been on Lopressor as recent as ___ but after discussing the situation with his wife, she monitored him closely and noticed that his heart rate was in the 50's therefore stopped the lopressor. There is no prior record of atrial fibrillation noted in his record. ",2029,410

Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= ___. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Severely depressed LV systolic dysfunction with anterior/anteroseptal akinesis and hypokinesis of all segments bar basal inferior/inferolateral segments. Dilated and depressed right ventricle. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation likely due to leaflet tethering. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension. . Chest Xray ___ Moderate bilateral pleural effusions layer dependently. Cardiac silhouette has a peculiar shape, and a larger than expected component to the right of midline. Whether this is due to cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion is indeterminate. There is no particular distention of either pulmonary or mediastinal vasculature to suggest one or the other. Bibasilar atelectasis is relatively mild, and there is no pulmonary edema. Aortic contour is normal. . ___ When compared to the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The right heart border is now sharply seen, as is the hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial decrease in pleural effusion. However, this could represent a more erect position of the patient rather than significant fluid decrease. There is opacification at the left base consistent with a small effusion on this side. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg TID Glipizide 5mg Qd Prednisione 5mg Qdaily Lorazepam 0.25mg Q12 H PRN agitation Cyclosporine 50mg BID Mycophenolate Mofetil 500mg BID Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID Flagyl 500mg TID MVI <DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS> 1. prednisone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). 2. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for insomnia/anxiety .

A TTE showed a EF of ___ anterior/anteroseptal akinesis and hypokinesis as well as moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. She was diuresed with bolus doses of IV lasix (40 mg BID) approximately ___ L per day for 4 days. Her weight on admission was 64.8 kg and 59 kg on discharge. She was transitioned to oral lasix 40 mg BID. Cardiology was consulted a felt presentation was not complete consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy and possibly reflective of a tachymyopathy. She will however need further imaging with a MIBI or possible catheterization as an outpatient. She will also need a repeat TTE to evaluate valve and ventricular function now that she is no longer volume overloaded. She would likely also benefit from initiation as an ACEi as an outpatient when renal function improves. . ___ creatinine was 1.8 on admission from a baseline of 1.2. This was felt to likely reflect poor cardiac forward flow leading to hypoperfusion. Patient was diuresed as above with improvement in her creatinine to 1.6.

You were admitted for left sided chest pain, and there was concern for a possible blood clot in your lungs. A study was performed that showed that it is unlikely that there was a clot in your lung. However, you had high fevers, and there was concern for infection given that you take immune suppressive medications. An ultrasound showed cysts in your liver, and bile duct dilation, which will need to get followed up with an outpatient gastroenterologist. You were treated empirically with broad antibiotics and these were changed to levofloxacin to treat for community acquired pneumonia. Please monitor your INR very closely given that it may fluctuate with your antibiotics. Please follow up with the appointments as scheduled below. Please continue to take your medications, and take your coumadin daily unless instructed otherwise by your doctor. Again, it has been a pleasure taking part in your care, and we wish you the best. Sincerely, - Your ___ care team ","___ s/p renal transplant in ___ (unable to obtain IV dye), on immunosuppresion, s/p bilateral nephrectomies, afib on coumadin recently sub-therapeutic, who presents with ___ days of pleuritic chest pain under her left breast after 12 hours driving which resolved upon presentation. CP was of unclear cause. VQ scan was low probability. Patient notes some exercise recently and thinks this may have caused her pain. cardiac enzymes negative, EKG reassuring for ACS. patient was subtherapeutic on coumadin and has CHADS2 score of 3, and was treated with heparin gtt. Patient had fevers of unknown etiology, blood cultures were drawn which were pending at time of discharge. The patient remained afebrile for 24 hours and was treated for presumed community acquired pneumonia given her subjective symptoms of pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion on admission CXR. # FEVERS - Pt admitted for chest pain but spiked low grade fevers during admission. Initially placed on empiric vancomycin and zosyn, but continued spiking fevers without apparent source. CXR showed minor pulmonary effusion on the R side. No localizing infectious symptoms, and fever resolved. Has reportedly had history of liver cyts which were again demonstrated on RUQ US without RUQ tenderness to palpation, thus not believed to be the source of intermittent fevers. The patient remained afebrile for 24 hours and was treated for presumed community acquired pneumonia given her subjective symptoms of pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion on admission CXR without obvious localizing infectious signs, clear V/Q scan, and negative urine and blood cultures at the time of discharge. # CP: The patient had an admission EKG and troponins reassuring for ACS, but reported pleuritic chest pain on admission. Given a sub-therapeutic INR the patient was begun on a heparin drip, and with a recent history of travel and elevated d-dimer a V/Q scan was ordered which showed low probability of a pullmonary embolism. The patient's chest pain resolved completely by hospital day 2. Given that her only subjective complaint on admission was pleuritic chest pain, it was believed that her pain likely stemmed from a parapneumonic effusion and the patient was treated for community acquired pneumonia. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # AFIB - ensure patient taking coumadin 2 mg. Follow up INR on ___ # Liver cysts and sacular intrahepatic bile duct dilation - Noted on RUQ US to assess for possible fever source. Radiology recommended MRCP for further evaluation. Pls consider GI referral if needed.

","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented to ___ on ___ with the chief complaint of abdominal pain; evaluation in the ED by surgery revealed localized abdominal pain, with clinical and radiological signs of an acute abdomen with concern for an internal hernia. The patient was taken to the OR for a lysis of adhesions and relief of obstruction due to multiple adhesions into the pelvis causing an internal loop obstruction. The patient tolerated the procedure well, please refer to the operative report for further details. Post-procedure the patient was extubated in PACU due to prolonged sedation, which went unremarkably. He did receive 24 hours of cefazolin after surgery, in addition to 5% albumin for a total of 500cc for volume support. On POD1: The patient was kept NPO, with a NG tube in place. He electrolytes were closely monitored and repleted as necessary. His pain was further managed with IV and PO pain medications. POD2: a NGT clamp trial was performed, and the patient was started on glutamine supplementation. His electrolytes were continued to be closely monitored and repleted. There was a concern for a RUE DVT due to difficult CVL placement in the OR; however, a repeat RUE/neck US showed no evidence of a DVT. POD3: the patient underwent a KUB, which did not show signs of obstruction or ileus. NGT was dc'd, and the patient was kept NPO. He electrolytes were repleted as per protocol. His foley catheter was removed at mid-night, and the patient voided spontaneously. POD4: the patient complained of a cough with intermittent sputum production, he was given a PRN nebulizer therapy and a PA/LAT cxr was consistent with clearing of a prior mucous plug. The patient was started on a clear liquid diet, and his IVF were stopped once he was taking in a good amount PO. His home Lasix dose was continued as well. The patient's expected post-operative pain and transient electrolyte abnormalities were followed and corrected. POD5: overnight the patient complained of ___ erythema, along with fluctuance and increased pain/tenderness. An Abd/Pelv CT scan without contrast revealed a large right rectus sheath hematoma measuring 9 x 5.9 x 8.5 cm with evidence of active extravasation; given those findings, several wound staples were removed at bed-side with the plan to take to OR as soon as possible. The patient received a ___ in the interim due to continuous oozing from his abdominal wound. A foley was placed due to urinary retention. The patient was taken to the OR and a rectus sheath hematoma was evacuated, and any active bleeders were treated with argon beam laser. A wound vac was placed in the OR for wound management. Post-op the patient's medications were resumed, and he was started on a clear liquid diet. POD6: the patient tolerated his clear diet well and was advanced to a regular diet, while his IVF were dc'd. His diuretics were restarted and he was given 1U of FFP due to a high INR and anticipation of a paracentesis. The patient's levaquin for presumed pneumonia was changed to vanc, cefepime for broader coverage; in addition, he underwent a nasal MRSA screen which was negative, along with sputum cx which grew commensal flora. The patient under paracentesis due to abdominal distention, where 0.8L were removed, and cell count was not consistent with SBP. The patient received 12.5 grams of albumin for repletion. POD7: the patient was restarted on his lactulose, his foley dc'd, and a vac placed. POD8: the patient was managed for his routine pain control, electrolyte repletion, along with ambulation. POD9: a physical therapy consult was placed, and the patient resumed his PO levaquin to complete a 7-day course. POD10-11: an occupation therapy consult was placed, and the patient was discharged to rehab. The patient's vac was changed on ___ its measurements are 5cmX2cmX1cm deep, and the vac is set on min suction at -75 mmHg At the time of discharge, the patient was comfortable with the discharge plan and recommendations.

He underwent exploratory laparotomy by Dr. ___, but was found to have a frozen abdomen thus unable to see perforated stomach. Postop, he was transferred to the SICU for management as he was hypotensive and hematocrit had decreased. He was given albumin and 4 units of PRBC. Hct stabilized, but on ___, he had brief episode of SVT with rate of 160 without blood pressure drop; afib with intermittent RVR that was treated with metoprolol IV x 2 with decrease in BP. The patient required pressors and amiodarone was started (please see #Afib below). He transferred out of the SICU and was started on TPN. Afib was managed with metoprolol. Metoprolol dose was increased and he was given intermittent doses of Lasix for volume control and pulmonary edema seen on CXR. His diet was initially advanced to clears then full liquids. However, he did not tolerate advancement to a regular diet. He experienced a lot of abdominal pain. Diet was changed to just sips of clears and pain was managed with a Dilaudid PCA. His diet was eventually changed to tube feeds and then regular diet as per an initial goals of care discussion. An abdominal CT ___ an 8cm loculated fluid collection in lesser sac. He then underwent ___ placement of a drain in the fluid collection. Microbiology evaluation of the fluid collection did not grow any organisms, so antibiotics were discontinued on ___. ___ continued to follow the drain until output was < 5cc for 2 consecutive days, at which point the drain was pulled. Diet was advanced slowly for comfort, with supplemental nutrition from nasogastric tube feeds. After a goals of care meeting on ___, Pt endorsed a desire to transition towards measures that would improve his comfort. In light of this, his NGT was pulled ___ and he was permitted a regular PO diet, which he tolerated well. Patient was continued on sucralfate for continued gastric coating and comfort.

Patient was discharged to a ___ facility for housing and further titration of his care. # ETOH/HCV CIRRHOSIS with # ASCITES and # NEED FOR SBP PPX: Previously complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, grade I esophageal varices. Pt without significant hepatic encephalopathy or large ascites during his hospital stay; he was initially put on oral diuretics to minimize the ascites and risk of wound dehiscence, but these were held in the setting of significant weight loss while on tube feeds and overall hypo- to euvolemic appearance on exam. Patient was continued on Bactrim for SBP prophylaxis. He was continued on lactulose to keep his mental status clear. Given goals of care discussion as above, vitamins such as thiamine and multivitamin were discontinued. # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Had one episode of Afib on ___, for which he was amiodarone loaded and started on amio gtt. He was stable on PO metoprolol in-house, though sometimes limited due to soft blood pressures. He had a CHADS-VASC of 0. Given his goals of care discussion at discharge, PO metoprolol was discontinued. Anticoagulation was deferred given recent surgery as well as goals of care discussion as above. # NUTRITION: Initially requiring TPN, then tube feeds by ___. He continued to lose muscle mass despite optimal nutrition on TF's. After goals of care discussion ___, patient was provided with a regular diet - which he tolerated well.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Mr. ___, You were admitted to the hospital after you were found to have a blockage of your bile ducts causing a serious infection called cholangitis. You were also found to have bacteria in your blood stream. You underwent an ERCP with a plastic stent placed. After the procedure your bilirubin continued to rise and you underwent a second ERCP to place a metal stent. For your serious infection you were started on IV antibiotics and will need to continue this for two weeks. This blockage in the bile duct was caused by a stricture. Samples of the stricture were taken and found to be cancer (adenocarcinoma). You were seen by the oncology team and have follow up with them in a few days to talk about treatment options. It was a pleasure caring for you, Your ___ Team ","SUMMARY/ASSESSMENT: Mr. ___ is a ___ male with IDDM, HTN, BPH, and metastatic clear cell RCC s/p radical L nephrectomy (___) on chemotherapy (sunitinib), with recent admission (___) for biliary stricture s/p ERCP with plastic stent placement (CBD brushing cytology non-diagnostic) and non-occlusive portal vein thrombus started on enoxaparin who presented to the ED with fever, jaundice, and confusion, found to have persistent intrahepatic biliary dilation and gallbladder sludge on ___ US s/p ERCP x2 with placement of plastic, then metal biliary stent and EUS with pathology from FNB of CBD mass consistent with new pancreatobiliary adenocardinoma. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # Cholangitis # Strep spp. (likely Enterococcus) bacteremia # Adenocarcinoma pancreaticobiliary origin He presented with fever, jaundice, and mental status changes. RUQ US also showed persistent left intrahepatic biliary dilation and gallbladder sludge despite the presence of CBD stent, suggesting that the stent was non-functioning/occluded or there was some other source of obstruction. The CBD brushing cytology from his prior ERCP was non-diagnostic. He had no apparent mass in the head of the pancreas on imaging but there remained some concern for a primary pancreatobiliary tumor so he was planned to have a repeat ERCP and EUS the week he was admitted. Blood culture at ___ is growing Strep spp. He was treated with Unasyn for cholangitis as well as Strep bacteremia. BCx here grew Strep anginosus. He had an ERCP on ___ with removal of the old stent and placement of a new stent over a 2cm malignant-appearing stricture of the distal CBD. Cytology brushings were sampled. EUS was completed on which they visualized a 1.8 x 1.1 cm ill-defined hypoechoic area around the distal CBD. FNB was performed x3. Pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma. After the plastic stent placement, his LFTs did not improve and bilirubin continued to rise. A repeat ERCP was done on ___ with removal of the plastic stent and placement of a metal stent. After this, his LFTs started to improve. His Unasyn was changed to ceftriaxone and metronidazole for ease of dosing to complete a 2 week course ___ - ___. A PICC was placed prior to discharge. TTE did not show evidence of endocarditis. # ___ on CKD Cr peaked at 1.8 from baseline 1.2. Most likely this was prerenal in the setting of cholangitis. It improved after ERCP, antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation. # PVT He was found to have a non-occlusive portal vein thrombus on MRCP during his recent hospital admission and was started on enoxaparin. HIs home enoxaparin was initially held for ERCP, then resumed. # Macrocytic anemia Macrocytic anemia is chronic. Baseline H/H appears to be ___, so he is lower than baseline. He had no signs of bleeding. Recent TSH, folate, B12, ferritin, and TIBC were wnl. Bilirubin is predominantly direct, so less likely hemolysis. Other hemolysis labs were not consistent with hemolysis. Acute on chronic anemia is perhaps ___ bone marrow suppression from sepsis. He was given 1 unit pRBCs for Hgb 7.6. # Metastatic clear cell RCC on chemotherapy He is followed at ___ by Dr. ___. He was diagnosed in ___ in workup of gross hematuria and flank pain. He underwent a laparoscopic radical right nephrectomy in ___. He was found to have metastases to the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and hilar lymph nodes in ___. In ___ he was enrolled in an experimental trial and started on sunatinib. His most recent CT showed clinical response. He is currently in his regularly scheduled two weeks off on sunatinib. He had a surveillance CT on ___ which showed no evidence of local recurrence of metastatic disease in the abdomen/pelvis. # LUL pneumonia He was found to have LUL opacity on CT chest ordered for surveillance. He was also complaining of cough. He was on Unasyn while inpatient, then transitioned to ceftriaxone and metronidazole for 2 weeks total, which should cover him for pneumonia. # HTN Initially his home atenolol dose was halved due to concern for cholangitis/impending sepsis. His home amlodipine 10 mg and lisinopril 40 mg daily were also initially held. These were resumed prior to or at discharge. # Insulin-dependent DM type II At home he takes glargine 16 units qhs if his FSBG is <170 and he takes 18 units qhs if his FBSG is >170. While inpatient, he was given glaring 8 units qhs as he was not taking much PO as well as lispro SSI. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # Hypothyroidism - continued home levothyroxine # Depression and anxiety - continued home fluoxetine; held home cariprazine as it is non-formulary Mr. ___ is clinically stable for discharge. The total time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes. ",3693,1204

Despite the fact that you initially improved, you subsequently worsened and the symptoms were all related to progressive cancer. We talked about the meaning of this with you and your family and you are opting to go home with hospice care. We put a gastric tube in to help alleviate any symptoms of obstruction. You should keep the gastric tube hooked up to low suction overnight and when you are not doing anything during the day. When you are active, and for ___ minutes after taking oral medications, you should clamp the tube. You were continued on most of your oral medications that you take at home. Over time, you may decide to discontinue these medications if they are not necessary for your comfort (for instance, your vitamin supplements), and can discuss this with your hospice team. The hospice team will help you manage your symptoms at home. We wish you the best of luck going forward. Thanks, Your ___ Team ","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, BPH, and three concurrent cancers: (1) metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, s/p radical L nephrectomy in ___, found to have pulmonary, mediastinal, and hilar metastases ___ (now off sunitinib without disease progression), (2) metastatic cholangiocarcinoma s/p 6 months gem/cisplatin, who subsequently had new (3) acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas, now on ___ I regimen of liposomal irinotecan and ___, last dose ___, who went to ___ clinic with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and was found to have possible SBO on KUB. This led to direct admission for workup. CT abdomen/pelvis with oral contrast showed no evidence of bowel obstruction, but showed findings of ileitis, as well as increasing pancreatic mass size and new hepatic lesions all concerning for progression of his cancer. While hospitalized, he developed recurrent symptoms of nausea, vomiting after an initial improvement, and then developed signs and symptoms of frank obstruction likely related to his pancreatic mass or peritoneal carcinomatosis. No further imaging was pursued. An NG tube was placed for decompression and he had significant improved symptoms. He subsequently underwent palliative venting G-tube is a transition to hospice. ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # Abdominal pain # Nausea and vomiting, with malignant obstruction, in setting of progressive acinar cell cancer, and large pancreatic mass # Acinar cell pancreatic cancer He has been off sutinib as his other cancers are being managed and his pulm/hepatic mets have been stable. He is not yet due for restaging imaging. He is due for ___, LV, liposomal irinotecan. His oncologists are Dr ___ ___ Dr ___ seen on ___. CT abdomen/pelvis showed increased size of pancreatic head mass (from 6.0 to 8.0 cm), numerous metastatic liver lesions (increased in size and number), interval worsening of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and new 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe. He had been having nausea and vomiting likely related to chemo for several weeks, but then developed diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain the night prior to presentation. His symptoms have resolved. He had 2 watery bowel movements after admission. KUB had showed multiple centrally located distended loops of small bowel, concerning for small bowel obstruction. He has not had prior bowel obstruction. Since he has only 1 kidney with a Cr of 1.6, initial CT was done without IV contrast. CT abdomen/pelvis with oral contrast showed no evidence of bowel obstruction, but showed wall thickening of distal and terminal ileum with adjacent fat stranding, compatible with infectious or inflammatory ileitis. Since he was afebrile with improved symptoms, empiric antibiotics were not started. C. difficile was negative as was ecoli. He was initially treated with bowel rest and IV fluids, then diet was advanced. The CT scan also showed increasing size of pancreatic mass, enlarging and new hepatic lesions, new left lung nodule, worsening retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, all concerning for progression of disease. Given this new complication of his pancreatic cancer, family meeting was held on ___, with a decision to pursue hospice care at home given no other therapeutic options. His prognosis was given as weeks. He was transitioned to liquid concentrated morphine for pain, as well as lorazepam for anxiety, and dexamethasone for nausea. Oral medications were given after his PEG was placed, with clear instructions on how to take them. This included dexamethasone, concentrated morphine, and olanzapine. Other home medications were continued at this time, with decisions to stop these medications going forward to occur with hospice services and Dr. ___, patient's oncologist. MOLST form was completed. # Acute on chronic anemia: Baseline hemoglobin is ___. Hemoglobin was low at 6.7 on ___, so he was transfused 1 unit PRBCs with improvement to 8.3. He had no obvious signs of acute blood loss anemia and stool has not appeared grossly bloody or signs of melena evident. His blood count remained stable. Labs were not checked after goals of care were changed. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine is 1.4-1.6 at baseline. He had recent ___ with Cr of 2.2 on ___ and 1.8 on admission, likely due to dehydration. Renal function returned to baseline after getting IV fluids then rose after he likely developed recurrent dehydration. As stated above labs were not rechecked after goals of care change. # History of Portal Vein Thrombus: He was continued on home Rivaroxaban 10mg daily, except for initially being held while NPO. This was continued for now, but should be stopped if decided not consistent with comfort going forward. # Severe protein-calorie malnutrition: He has low albumin and reported low oral intake due to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which has been ongoing off/on for weeks, likely due to chemo and his known cancers. Consulted nutrition who recommended low fiber diet with Ensure Clear early in hospitalization, but given transition to hospice, he was recommended to have diet as tolerated. # Type 2 diabetes: His glargine was initially decreased while NPO on IV D5LR, then stopped and treated with sliding scale insulin only and Glipizide was held. On discharge, glipizide was continued. TRANSITIONS OF CARE ------------------- # Follow-up: patient is being discharged to hospice. Dr. ___ ___ be the physician responsible for decisions going forward. # Code status: DNR/DNI, comfort-focused care ",3521,1232

","Mr. ___ is an ___ yo male w/ PMHx sig for atrial fibrillation on ___ transferred from ___ with R frontal and temporal DHs and R occipital IPH in the setting of supratheraputic INR, thought to be related from unknown trauma vs hypertension. # Subdural hematomas: The patient was found to have R frontal and temporal subdurals and R occipital IPH in the setting of supratherapeutic INR. This was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP. He was followed by NS, who determined that no surgical intervention was needed at this time and recommended that Keppra be started for seizure prophylaxis. They had initially recommended restarting ASA, but given the extent of his bleeds and discussion with his family, it was decided to hold anticoagulation until further evaluation with NSG in 1 month. The patient continued to have L sided weakness and L hemineglect on transfer to the floor, so Neurology was consulted. A repeat MRI revealed no evidence of acute infarct and stable size of his bleeds. They felt that his bleeds could explain his previous hemineglect. On repeat examination, Neurology felt his hemi neglect had and did not feel further intervention was needed. He is scheduled for NSG follow up in 1 month with repeat CT scan. # Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a h/o afib, for which he was on Coumadin and Toprol 25mg PO daily.

You underwent imaging to help further characterize what may be going on in your GI tract to cause these symptoms. You are scheduled for follow up with the surgery team to discuss the next steps in your diagnosis and treatment plan. Of note, your CT scan revealed a large goiter. The recommendation was to obtain an ultrasound to determine the presence of nodules. The ultrasound did reveal some nodules that were recommended for biopsy. However, it appears that you have recently undergone a thyroid nodule biopsy. Please continue to follow up with your thyroid specialist as previously scheduled. Please follow up with your primary care doctor as previously scheduled. It was a pleasure to be a part of your care!

She also had fluctuating inattentiveness. Was initially admitted to medicine, but MRI showed scattered punctate left hemisphere deep ___ infarctions as well as one in the splenium of the CC. MRA shows what looks like critical stenosis of the left carotid bifurcation ___: - Patient presented to ED with dizziness and subtle left-sided weakness with high BP (194/95). In the ED, she remained quite hypertensive (SBP 190-210), and all parts of neurological examination were normal except for a mild distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy in a stocking distribution. Overnight, her blood pressures were improved, remaining in the 130-140s, with blood sugars in the 200-250 range. She spiked one low grade fever to 100.2 while in house, but this spontaneously resolved. On my examination, she had a delayed reaction time and was quite indifferent and dysprosodic. There was a paucity of emotionality and facial expressions. She had no aphasia or dysarthria, and followed commands well. There was no neglect. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. ___: With the nonspecific findings on examination, the patient was admitted to the medicine service for a presumed hypertensive emergency. She was started on a baby aspirin. An MRI was recommended, and identified multiple small areas of restricted diffusion in the left hemisphere and splenium all consistent with a shower of emboli from a proximal embolic source. An MRA done at that time showed the presence of a stenosed left carotid bifurcation. Labs showed hyperglycemia and an elevated A1c to 9.3, consistent with poorly controlled DM. Her lipid panel returned showing an elevated TC (277), elevated LDL (169) and normal HDL(46). Her UA showed a urinary tract infection, and so she was started on ceftriaxone. Upon discovery of the stroke, the patient has been transferred to the neurology stroke service for continued work up and care. Echo on ___ showed: IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function (LVEF >55%). No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified. Carotid Duplex on ___ showed: IMPRESSION: Significant stenosis at the origin of the left internal carotid artery, estimated between 80 and 99%. On the right, there is also significant stenosis at the origin of the ICA, with estimated 40-59% narrowing. ___: In light of discovering significant stenosis at the origin of the left internal carotid artery, estimated between 80 and 99%, urgent vascular surgery consult was initiated and heparin gtt was started (goal 50-70, PTT q6h). - Will stop ASA 325mg daily while on heparin drip - HOB down and allow BP autoregulation. - Continue atorvastatin 40mg daily - Supportive care with insulin sliding scale, PRN tylenol, CIWA scale, nicotine patch, etc. - Continue ceftriaxone for UTI - ___ consult - Placed SW consults in light of poor previous medical care, new diagnosis. The patient underwent emergent left CEA on ___ (see operative note for details). The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the OR and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition. Overnight on ___, the patient experienced confusion and weakness of the right upper extremity; anisocria was seen on examination. Neurology was consulted who recommended avoidance of hypotension with goal SBP 120-160, continue aspirin/statin and repeat MRI of head to look for additional infarcts. A CTA of the head and neck was performed on ___ that showed increase in size of hypodensities in the left basal ganglia and left frontal lobe compared to the previous MR with possibility of new infarcts. This was followed by a MR1 Head that confirmed the presence of multiple, predominantly left infarctions as above, with interval increase in the size of infarctions, as well as multiple new foci of infarction, including a right paramedian focus. There was also concern for a left frontal hypointensity on gradient-echo imaging suggesting blood products. The next day on ___ the patient complained of headache so Neurology was consulted again who recommended obtaining a repeat CT brain to document stability of the left frontal lobe petechial hemorrhage. The patient's aspirin and SQH were held and an MRI Head w/o contrast was performed on ___. The repeat MRI confirmed resolution of hemorrhage seen the previous day. That same day the patient underwent a speech/swallowing evaluation the next day following which her diet was progressed. ___ were on board throughout the ___ hospital stay. On ___, the patient's motor function appeared to be stable (barring some fluctuation due to difficulty with cooperating) and there was improvement in speech so the goal was to achieve normotension with a SBP <150, avoid hypotension, continue aspirin/statin, re-start heparin SQ TID for DVT prophylaxis, diabetic diet/heart healthy diet, and insulin sliding scale for goal normoglycemia. ___ was consulted, given the patient's uncontrolled blood sugar levels and HBA1C of 9%, following which she was started on oral hyperglycemics and Humalog sliding scale. Over ___, the patient has continued to make excellent progress. Her medical issues are well under control and after soliciting re-evaluation from Neurology and ___ ___ she was deemed stable for discharge to an acute rehab facility of her family's choice in ___. There the patient will continue to receive extensive ___ and speech therapy and will follow up with Vascualr Surgery, Neurology and ___ ___ in the coming weeks. ",2841,1281

He has been on Lupron therapy since ___ and his residual urine volume today is 234 mL. Indeed rectal exam reveals a tumor outside the capsule. A history and physical was done and I went over the operation with the patient and his wife including the fact that part of his obstructive problem is lack of dynamic voiding due to scarring and infiltration of the tumor into the bladder neck area. Therefore, removing the obstruction may not completely free up his voiding such that he may still have an elevated residual urine volume, but it should be better than it is today. In addition, I will leave a small amount of extra tissue at the apex to assure against incontinence as the entire prostatic area may be somewhat rigid and removing all of the prostatic tissue could result in incontinence.

Because you had a recent GI bleed when you were on blood thinners (Pradaxa) for your atrial fibrillation, we placed a removable filter (IVC filter) in the vein leading to your heart to protect you from a clot entering the lungs (pulmonary embolus). This filter is temporary and should be removed in 3 months. You have expressed interest in transferring your cardiology care to the ___, so we set up a follow up appointment with a cardiologist here (below) who will remove the filter in the future and help decide whether or not you will need blood thinners in the future for your atrial fibrillation. We also reviewed the records from ___ from the gastroenterologists who performed the colonoscopy, endoscopy, and capsule study. You should follow up with your PCP to get ___ referral for a GI appointment at the ___ so they can explore the possibility of additional studies to find the source of bleeding. You also have to get a referral from your PCP to get ___ follow up appointment for a hematologist here (Dr. ___ or colleagues) who will discuss possible blood testing to determine why you formed a clot in your leg. It is unclear why you formed a clot in your leg, this could be due to your recent hospitalization, but it could also be due to low level inflammation which could be from a variety of causes such as infection or a cancer. You could also be at a genetically higher risk of forming clots. It was a pleasure taking care of you. ","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with afib (previously on dabigitran) and recent GI bleed with no source identified on endoscopy or colonoscopy from ___, who presented from clinic with a left lower extremity DVT and is now s/p IVC filter placement. # Left gastroc DVT: He was evaluated during a routine appointment with his cardiologist where on review of systems he endorsed left lower extremity pain and was sent to the ED where he was found to have a left gastroc DVT by ultrasound. It is unclear if unprovoked or provoked. During his recent hospitalization for GI bleed (below) he went without heparin SQ or DVT prophylaxis, but he was ambulating multiple times daily. In the ED was started on heparin drip. Given his recent GI bleed with unclear source, the decision was made to place an IVC filter as anticoagulation would put him at risk of continued bleed. IVC filter was placed on ___, and patient was set up with follow up with Dr. ___ will coordinate the removal of the filter in 3 months. Because he was over ___ and this was his first clot and he has no FH of clots, a hypercoaguable workup was not done in the hospital. Our concern, however, is that he may have an irreversible etiology for his DVT, such as a malignancy, especially in the setting of this GI bleed. He was given instructions to follow up with his PCP who will provide a referral for hematology follow up with Dr. ___ ___ or colleagues to further investigate a possible hypercoagulable state. # Recent GI bleed: Mr. ___ was recently admitted to ___ for a GI bleed while on Pradaxa. During that hospitalization (4 days total), he received 4 units PRBCs, EGD, colonoscopy, and a failed capsule endoscopy (did not make it to small bowel). ___ showed mild distal esophagitis, hiatal hernia, single tiny possible early ___ lesion and friability of the duodenal bulb. There was no obvious source of bleeding found. His dabigitran was discontinued during that admission (approximately two weeks prior to current admission). His last bloody bowel movement was 4 days prior to admission and he remained guaiac negative throughout hospitalization. Two large bore peripheral IVs were placed, an active type and screen was maintained and HCT was checked Q12H, which remained stable. He was started on iron at his prior hospitalization and that was continued. # Atrial fibrillation: He is currently in normal sinus rhythm without any perceptible episodes of afib since ___ when he was started on metoprolol. Metoprolow was continued during hospitalization with holding parameters. His Pradaxa was discontinued on prior hospitalization, but there was ongoing discussion of anticoagulation risks/benefits (CHADS 0 vs 2 with ? TIA) given this recent GI bleed. Likely he should avoid dabigitran, but depending on the opinions of his outpatient gastroenterologist and cardiologist, his case may warrant trial of daily aspirin vs. coumadin in future. # CODE STATUS: FULL confirmed # EMERGENCY CONTACT: friend ___ (patient would like her to be his HCP although needs to fill out paperwork) # Transitional issues: - Patient was scheduled with follow up appointment with PCP to arrange referrals for hematology with Dr. ___ or colleagues for workup of ? unprovoked DVT, cardiology with Dr. ___ IVC filter retrieval, and GI for possible re-scoping to find source of bleeding. - Patient will need IVC filter removal in 3 months from discharge (appointment scheduled with Dr. ___ in 1 month. - Patient will need cancer screening given possibly unprovoked DVT. - Patient will need to discuss with PCP and cardiologist the need for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation going forward. He was dischared on no form of anticoagulation given recent bleed. ",1731,839

You are recovering well and are now ready for discharge. Please follow the instructions below to continue your recovery: * Your injury caused 3 rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain. * You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician. * Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures. In order to decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 times every hour while awake. This will help expand the small airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that pool in the lungs. * You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing. * Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short periods may ease the pain. * Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible. * Do NOT smoke * If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side effects so make sure your doctor approves. * Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs (crepitus).

A CT Scan of your abdomen showed a hernia but showed no signs of a small bowel obstruction. We performed a rectal exam and identified multiple external hemorrhoids which likely caused the bleeding you noticed recently with your diarrhea. You were also found to have a urinary tract infection for which we gave you antibiotics that you will continue to take (by mouth) for another 4 days through ___. You were also found to have iron deficiency, for which you will take an iron supplement daily. You should continue to take the Tylenol that we prescribed for your abdominal pain until it resolves, and should apply the hydrocortisone cream for one week we prescribed for your hemorrhoids as needed. Lastly, we recommend that you eat a diet high in fiber to prevent future development or worsening of your hemorrhoids. It is very important that you follow up with your primary care physician and take your medications as prescribed. Please have your INR checked on ___. We wish you the best!

Mr. ___ reported sharp episodic non-radiating right side abdominal pain which came every ___ minutes then gradually dissipated before returning again. He had one loose, non-bloody bowel movement while in the ED but had no diarrhea during his hospitalization despite reporting a two week history of watery, non-bloody bowel movements ___ times per day which became tinged with blood 4 days prior to admission. CRP was wnl, CT A/P showed a hernia containing bowel but was negative for fat stranding, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and bowel obstruction. Rectal exam revealed multiple large external hemorrhoids. He was given Tylenol for pain and tolerated a clear liquids diet. He was started on a topical hydrocortisone BID for external hemorrhoids. He was evaluated by the surgical team given his hx of multiple abdominal surgeries and hernia, however no surgical intervention was advised. #Complicated Urinary Tract Infection: On admission Mr. ___ reported increased urinary frequency consistent with past UTIs. UA done in the ED was positive, so he was started on a 7 day course of Ceftriaxone 1g IV in the ED, and completed ___ days of the course during his hospital stay. Urine culture grew pan-sensitive E. coli. He was switched to PO Cefpodoxime for continuation of the remaining 5 days of this antibiotic course upon discharge. Given his history of multiple UTIs, Mr. ___ complicated UTI was believed to be secondary to urinary tract structural abnormality vs. prostatic enlargement. #Microcytic Anemia: Mr. ___ had low H/H with low MCV in the ED that persisted throughout his hospital stay. Iron studies showed iron deficiency anemia. He was started on Ferrous gluconate 324mg daily. His microcytic anemia was believed to be secondary to chronic bleeding from hemorrhoids vs. nutritional deficiency. Slow bleeding from occult GI malignancy is also possible. #Hypomagnesemia: On admission Mr. ___ was found to have low magnesium. He was given Magnesium Oxide, after which his magnesium level normalized. This hypomagnesemia was believed to be secondary to diarrhea in the setting of infectious enteritis vs. colitis. #Weight loss/Fe deficiency anemia: Mr. ___ reported unintentional 50lb weight loss over the past year. PSA sent on admission was within normal limits. Serum TSH level was sent as further workup of his weight loss, and will be followed up after discharge. Further workup for malignancy should be considered in the outpatient setting. #T2DM: Mr. ___ was started on Humalog sliding scale upon admission. His blood glucose remained stable throughout the admission. He will be restarted on his diabetes regimen of Glipizide and Metformin upon discharge. #History of PE and DVT: Mr. ___ was continued on his home dose of warfarin during his hospitalization and his INR remained therapeutic.

You underwent endoscopy of your upper GI tract which showed evidence of irritation of the stomach lining. There was an area of irritation where the stomach and esophagus meet which was most likely the source of your bleeding. You have been placed on a medicine to suppress acid production in your stomach. You should continue to take this until your follow up appointment with your new primary care physician in two weeks. You had biopsies taken from your stomach during the endoscopy. The results of your biopsies were normal without diagnostic abnormalities. You can follow up with your primary care physician regarding the results. ","___ male presents with acute onset of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and hematemesis. #Hematemesis: He does not have clear risk factors for upper GI bleed. He reports drinking normal amounts of coffee, denies recent or heavy NSAID use, although he does report drinking ___ drinks approximately twice a week. There was no history or symptoms consistent with PUD, GERD, or H. pylori as the presentation appears to have been acute over one to two days. He denies family history of bleeding or clotting disorders. Differential considered included bleeding ulcer ___ tear vs AVM. Given the extent of blood loss with evidence of early hemorrhagic shock including tachycardia on presentation, GI was consulted and performed an urgent EGD for evaluation which showed localized erythema in the gastroesophageal junction consistent with healed erosion or ___ tear, erythema consistent with gastritis in the antrum and fundus, and otherwise wnl to third part of duodenum. History and EGD findings were most consistent with ___ tear. Biopsies from antrum and GE junction returned grossly normal without diagnostic abnormalities. Patient received Pantoprazole 40 mg IV while in ED. He was kept on IV pantoprazole and switched to omeprazole 40 mg PO daily the evening after EGD. His diet was advanced following the procedure, and he tolerated a regular diet well prior to discharge. His vital signs remained normal and stable throughout his hospitalization, and he did not experience any further episodes of vomiting or hematemesis. Per GI recs, we discharged him on a two week course of omeprazole 40 mg PO daily. We set up follow-up with his PCP in two weeks. Patient was advised to avoid fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods and anything that could irritate his stomach. #Hemorrhagic shock - no hypotension He presented with tachycardia and orthostatic symptoms without blood pressure drop (headache, mild dizziness on rising from bed). He received 2L NS in ED with good heart rate response. Upon arrival to floor heart rate was trending back up and increased >120 with standing on several occassions. He underwent urgent EGD which did not reveal active bleeding. He received an additional 1L bolus of NS on transfer to the floor, and was maintained on ___ continuous at 75-125 ml/hr while he diet was advanced to a regular diet. He was maintained on telemetry, which was only notable for several non-sustained, asymptomatic episodes of tachycardia upon standing and walking. His vital signs were monitored throughout and he never developed hypotension, or other signs or symptoms of hypovolemia. Hematocrit was trended 44.2-->43.5-->39.3-->42.0 on ___, ___, and ___ respectively. Two 18 gauge peripheral IVs were maintained throughout his hospitalization, as well as active type and crossmatch.

FLOOR COURSE: Patient was admitted with diuretic refractory ascites. He was admitted for paracenteses and evaluation for TIPS and future transplant. The transplant team made the initial decision that the patient is not a TIPS or transplant candidate because of severe malnutrition, and goal became to improve nutritional status and then proceed. The patient's renal function began to worsen, and workup was consistent with hepatorenal syndrome. Nephrology was consulted, and agreed with HRS as the diagnosis, and he was started on midodrine, octreotide and daily albumin. As his renal failure progressed, he required dialysis and had a dialysis line placed ___. His worsening renal function led to the decision to expedite his transplant eligibility. Because he has a history of CAD and is s/p 2 stents from ___, he had to undergo a cardiac catheterization for evaluation of CAD and transplant eligibility. He went for cardiac cath on ___, which found no interventional lesions. However, the day after the procedure he developed a retroperitoneal bleed, which led to transfer to the ICU. MICU COURSE: # Shock: Initially secondary to hemorrhagic shock due to retroperitoneal bleed requiring massive transfusion protocol on arrival to the MICU. He was resuscitated though subsequently had ongoing septic shock physiology requiring pressor support. Etiology of septic shock was secondary to new infections including serratia UTI, E.coli bacteremia, MSSA VAP. Despite completing a course of antibiotics (Vanc/Meropenem) for all of these infections by ___ he had a persistent and rising leukocytosis. Infectious disease was consulted for assistance with workup and management. Micafungin was added for empiric fungal coverage. His HD line (placed in the setting of renal failure as below) was removed. Pus was noted around the insertion site, suggesting a line infection as a possible contributing source. Blood cultures, however, remained negative. Peritoneal fluid was also not suggestive of infection. Note is made of peritoneal fluid from ___, which appears inflammatory, despite correction for RBC count. Cultures were negative, however and subsequent pleural fluid did not suggest spontaneous or secondary bacterial peritonitis. Alternative etiology potentially secondary to persisent gut translocation into the peritoneal space. His leukocytosis downtrended without a clear source of ongoing infection. # Respiratory failure: Mr. ___ was initially intubated in the setting of hemorrhagic shock and metabolic acidosis. His course was then complicated by MSSA VAP. After correction of metabolic acidosis he remained intubated in the setting of altered mental status, volume overload, and impaired lung dynamics in the setting of ascites. Yet, despite clearing of his mental status, improvement of volume status with HD, and large volume paracenteses it was not possible to wean him off of the ventilator. He remained intubated for more than two weeks with a likely contribution from respiratory muscle weakness in the setting of prolonged intubation. He had ongoing thick secretions requiring repeated bronchoscopies for clearance of mucous plugging and LLL collapse. Tracheostomy was discussed with the patient and family. The patient clearly indicated that he did not want a tracheostomy, nor did he want to remain intubated. Rather, he made it clear that he wanted to be extubated to comfort care. He was extubated on the evening of ___ and passed within a few hours. Family was at bedside. # Renal failure: Mr. ___ was noted to have progressively worsening renal function prior to MICU transfer, consistent with hepatorenal syndrome. He was started on midodrine and octreotide as well as albumin. His renal failure progressed requiring dialysis and a dialysis line was placed ___. He continued on CVVH while in the ICU and was ultimately transitioned to intermittent HD. His HD line was removed as noted above in the setting of persistent leukocytosis for a line holiday. A temporary line was replaced given ongoing dialysis needs. He required pressors in the ICU in order to tolerate fluid removal with HD. # MSSA pneumonia: Noted to have MSSA pneumonia from sputum culture on ___. He was initially treated with Vancomycin pending sensitivities. However, he was continued on Vancomycin despite penicillin sensitivity in order to prevent inducible serratia resistance in the setting of serratia UTI, as below. He completed a course of antibiotics on ___, though antibiotics were continued as noted above in the setting of ongoing leukocytosis. # E.coli bacteremia: E.coli noted on blood culture on ___. He was initially treated with Meropenem for GNR bacteremia and completed a 2 week course of meropenem on ___, though antibiotics were continued in the setting of persistent leukocytosis as above and concern for ongoing gut translocation. # Serratia UTI: Noted on urine culture on ___. He was treated with a course of meropenem. # Atrial flutter/fib: MICU course was complicated by recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter. This initially occurred in the setting of volume removal with CVVH and responded well to doses of metoprolol or diltiazem. He developed atrial fibrillation with hypotension requiring pressors later in his ICU course during bronchoscopy, requiring amiodarone. He was continued on amiodarone until his he was transitioned to comfort measures. # Ileus: Mr. ___ malnutrition was noted while he was on the floor and prior to MICU transfer. After intubation an NGT was placed and tube feeds were initiated. He had high residuals that precluded goal tube feeding. CT A/P did not reveal obstructive pathology. Concern for potential peritonitis causing ileus, though ileus persisted despite negative peritoneal cultures. Ileus did not improve with reglan. He was started on TPN. A dophoff was placed, advanced post-pyloric by ___. # Decompensated Cirrhosis: Mr. ___ had worsening liver failure with rising bilirubin and MELD score throughout his hospital stay in the setting of multiple complications as noted below. Also with renal failure requiring HD. MICU team and liver attending had ongoing family meetings regarding potential for liver/kidney transplant. As his hospital course progressed it became increasingly clear that he would not recover to be well enough for a transplant. His family struggled to come to terms with this. Ultimately he indicated that he wanted to be extubated to CMO and passed within a few hours. Family was at bedside. ",3473,1429

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were treated in the hospital for pneumonia and vomitting up of blood clots that likely developed because of vomitting, diarrhea, and fevers (possibly due to a stomach flu) as well as high doses of aspirin that worsened your stomach and small intestine ulcers. It is important that you complete the course of antibiotics for treatment of your pneumonia. Please take Levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth daily and metronidazole 500 mg by mouth every 8 hours for six more days. As you know, you were given many liters of fluids through your veins while you were in the intensive care unit because you were so sick. You will continue to urinate out this fluid within the next several days. Because you vomitted blood, we took a look at your esophagus, stomach, and upper small intestines with a camera. We saw that you have an ulcer in your stomach and several ulcers of your upper small intestine. To help treat your ulcers, it is important that you start to take Prilosec (omeprazole) 40mg twice a day. It is also important that you avoid all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, alleve, and aspirin. You may take tylenol. You developed new diarrhea in the hospital. This is most likely likely due to antibiotics and should resolve as your gut flora return. You can take yogurt or lactobacillus supplements to accelerate this process. If your diarrhea gets worse or you develop any fevers, please see your doctor. Finally, it is important that you begin to see a primary care doctor regularly. Please follow-up regarding this hospitalization with ___ NP (see appointment below). At that time, you will also be set up with a primary care doctor. We have made the following changes to your medications: START Levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth daily and metronidazole 500 mg by mouth every 8 hours for six more days. START Pantoprazole 40mg by mouth twice a day ","___ year old woman with no known medical history who presented with subjective fevers, abdominal pain, and hematemesis and developed hypoxic respiratory failure. Clinical picture likely consistent with an initial gastroenteritis with emesis likely leading to aspiration pneumonia and hematemesis. # Hematemesis: EGD revealed mild esophagitis, a non-bleeding 7mm ulcer in the pylorus, and several superficial non-bleeding ulcers ranging in size from 3mm to 5mm in the duodenal bulb. This was likely due to aspirin use and recurrent emesis. H. pylori antibody is negative. Her HCT continued to rise and she was transitioned from a pantoprazole gtt to pantoprazole 40mg PO Q12h. # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Patient developed fevers and new hypoxia on ___. She was empirically treated for pneumonia with ceftriaxone. CT chest showed likely multifocal pneumonia which was possible due to aspiration. Given these findings, antibiotics were broadened to vanc/levo/flagyl and ID was consulted. The vanc was discontinued on ___ and the patient was discharged with PO levo and flagyl for likely aspiration pneumonia. Her pulmonary status improved significantly during hosptialization and she was satting 100% on RA at discharge. # Volume overload: the patient received over 12L of IV fluids in the ICU in the setting of hypotension (BP 80/40s with fever, mottled legs, likely sepsis with pulmonary source). After pt stabalized, she was gently diuresed. # Diarrhea/Abdominal Pain: Likely viral gastroenteritis as this resolved during the hospitalization. Stool cultures, including C diff, were negative. # Tick Bite: Recent tick bite removed quickly. Lyme serologies were negative and smear was negative for babesiosis although ANAPLASMA PHAGOCYTOPHILUM was negative. . # Transaminitis: Very mild transaminitis (50s). No RUQ pain, no hyperbilirubinemia. Likely related to viral gastroenteritis/acute infectious process. Transitional issues/INcidental radiographic findings. -Pt will require primary care follow up: has not seen a PCP ___ ___ years. Would follow LFT's as well. -Pt has recently decided to stop smoking. Outpatient support should be provided to support this goal. -Pt still mildly volume overload at discharge. She was mobilizing and self-diuresing effectively and will follow up with PCP closely to see if she would benefit from lasix. -___ WAS NOTED TO HAVE ESOPHAGEAL WALL THICKENING ON CT WITH CONFLUENT LYMPHADENOPATHY THAT FAVORED AN INFLAMMATORY PROCESS.

You were admitted following your cardiac catheterization in which 5 drug coated stents were placed to open a blockage in your right coronary artery. Procedure was complicated by tearing in the right coronary artery which was fixed with a stent. Echo did not show any complications. Instructions regarding care of the access site are included with your discharge information. WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AFTER YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? Please continue your current medications with the following changes: - continue Aspirin 81mg daily for one month, then STOP. You will go back on aspirin after one year when you come off Plavix. - Start Plavix 75mg daily, you should take this for a minimum of one year and ONLY stop when told by a cardiologist specifically. - Stop Pravastatin and start Atorvastain 80 mg daily - Continue to to take Coumadin (Warfarin) per Dr. ___ ___ - Continue all other medications without any change. It is very important to take all of your heart healthy medications. In particular, aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) help to keep the stents in the vessels of the heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future heart attack. If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot forming in your heart stents which could cause a life threatening heart attack. Please do not stop taking either medication without talking to your heart doctor, even if another doctor tells you to stop the medications. It is strongly recommended that you attend a cardiac rehab program in the near future. A referral form was provided to you that lists the locations of these programs. Please bring this with you to your follow up visit with your cardiologist, and they will inform you when it is safe to begin a program. If you were given any prescriptions on discharge, any future refills will need to be authorized by your outpatient providers, primary care or cardiologist.

The procedure was complicated by aortic root/proximal RCA dissection. He was transferred to the CCU for monitoring post procedure and had improvement of his chest pain and stabilization of his blood pressure. Medical therapy was titrated on the floor prior to discharge. #CORONARIES: CABG ___ with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, and SVG-RCA, s/p ___ 5 to RCA CTO ___ c/b aortic root/RCA dissection #PUMP: EF 51%, 1+ MR/TR/AR, mod RV dilation #RHYTHM: atrial fibrillation Transitional Issues: ==================== [] Patient reported interest in switching over to a DOAC, though was hesitant to do so without speaking to his outpatient cardiologist. Would consider transition from warfarin to a DOAC. [] He was started on triple therapy due to ___. He should be continued on this for 1 month with plan to discontinue the ASA at that point. In one year, his Plavix should be replaced by ASA [] Should consider cardiac rehab program after discharge [] He was transitioned from pravastatin 20mg to atorvastatin 80mg. ACUTE ISSUES: =============== # CAD s/p CABG # s/p ___ 5 to RCA CTO ___ c/b aortic root/RCA dissection Patient with history of CAD with CABG in ___ (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, and SVG-RCA). On his most recent cath, patient was noted to have CTO of mid LAD, LIMA-LAD patent, occluded SVG-OM and RCA, and CTO of the RCA. Due to ongoing chest pain despite 3 antianginal medications, he underwent elective revascularization of his known CTO RCA. During this hospitalization, his coronary angiogram showed severe tortuosity beginning in the mid segment of the RCA, with 70% stenosis with a TIMI flow grade of 0 in the proximal and mid segments, a 100% stenosis in the mid and distal segments, and significant collaterals. During initial access to through R radial catheter was kinked and angiogram showed a small perforation in the brachial artery that was closed with a Fr. guide and a BP cuff. Access was then obtained through L radial, 5 stents total were placed to the RCA. Angiogram during cath showed distal dissection into the RPDA/RPL (wire induced most likely, no intervention performed) with TIMI 3 flow, as well as an aortic root/proximal RCA dissection at the origin requiring ___. Final angiogram showed no residual, stable ___ RCA/ aortic dissection as well as distal RPDA dissection and TIMI 3 flow. Following the procedure, he continued to report chest pain and was started on an IV nitro drip with a brief drop of his blood pressure when he was given morphine. He was admitted to the CCU on the nitro drip and his BP stabilized and his chest pain resolved. His CK-MB was trended and peaked prior to discharge. Focused TTE showed overall preserved left ventricular systolic function and normal right ventricle free wall motion, no pericardial effusion. He was discharged on atorvastatin 80mg, ASA, Plavix, and warfarin with plan to continue triple therapy for 1 month and then continue with Plavix and warfarin. His anti-anginal medications were not changed during this admission. # A fib: He was started on a heparin drip while inpatient and started on warfarin 5mg two days prior to discharge.

We improved your kidney function with an albumin (protein) infusion and fluids. You received two large volume paracenteses to remove some of your ascites from your abdomen. Additionally, you had low-grade fevers during your hospitalization that was concerning for a possible infection of the fluid in your belly. You were treated with antibiotics for this infection and were started on prophylactic antibiotics to be continued to decrease the chance of recurrence of infection. Additionally, you were found to have developing low blood counts during this hospitalization that was concerning for a bleed in your gastrointestinal tract. You received a blood transfusion and an EGD (endoscopy). The endoscopy revealed no evidence of esophageal varices, but did show that your stomach and intestine were inflamed (gastritis, duodenitis). You were started on a proton-pump inhibitor (omeprazole) to help treat this condition. It is extremely important that you COMPLETELY ABSTAIN from alcohol. Any further alcohol at this point will severely damage your liver and put you at increased risk for complete liver failure and death. Please make your follow up appointments as listed below. The following medications were changed: ADDED ciprofloxacin to decrease the chance of infection in your abdomen ADDED omeprazole to treat your gastritis / duodenitis ADDED furosemide (lasix), a diuretic to help reduce the accumulation of fluid in your abdomen ADDED spironolactone, a diuretic to help reduce the accumulation of fluid in your abdomen ADDED lactulose, a laxative medication that helps to decrease the risk of developing confusion in patients with liver failure ADDED oxycodone to help you with pain control from your abdominal swelling in the short term ADDED thiamine and folate, vitamins to help supplement your diet ","# ARF, EtOH cirrhosis - The patient presented in acute renal failure with Cr 2.3 on admission (0.9 per outside hospital records on ___. She was given an albumin challenge for assessment of pre-renal vs. hepatorenal syndrome, and her creatinine quickly improved. Her diuretics, which had initially been held for renal failure, were restarted; she was unable to have a significant negative diuresis but maintained relatively even I+Os once uptitrated to lasix 40 mg po bid and aldactone 100 mg/d. She required two large volume paracenteses during this admission, in which a total of 6.5 L was removed (2L, 4.5L). As part of workup for cirrhosis, outside records were reviewed, which indicated a normal a1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin levels. Iron levels were WNL, although one note mentions a high transferrin saturation and a possible workup for hemachromatosis. On our workup, hepatitis A, B, C serologies were sent and were negative, including HbsAb. ___ neg, IgG/IgM WNL. Anti-SMA was positive at 1:20 titer. At this time we believe the anti-SMA titer is not significant enough to raise strong clinical suspicion for an autoimmune hepatitis, especially given a strong EtOH history and an AST/ALT ratio consistent with this. Further assessment to be done as as an outpatient. # leukocytosis - DDx initially worrisome for cholangitis (given CBD dilation on RUQ U/S) or SBP (although diagnostic para in ED was negative; this was in the setting of ongoing levofloxacin therapy). MRCP was performed and was negative for evidence of dilation or stone in biliary tree. Patient was treated empirically for SBP regardless with five days of high dose CTX and was switched to cipro for ppx. Pt was initially febrile during admission but defervesced with no proven source of infection. Leukocytosis improved during hospitalization (10.8 <-- 17.8 since admission). - UCx ___ shows <10^5 VRE in setting of normal urine dipstick. Repeat UCx ___ negative. All UAs have been negative. Likely represents contaminant, no role for treatment. # EtOH abuse - Patient reports that last drink was over two weeks ago, with no history of withdrawal or seizures. Stressed significance of total alcohol cessation on discharge. Patient was discharged on thiamine, folate, MVI. # anemia - Hct decreased to 22.0 (<-- 26.2 <-- 31.0) earlier in admission. Hct stabilized at ___ after 1u pRBC ___. ___ be partially ___ intravascular volume depletion and subsequent expansion with albumin, but positive stool guaiac on admission was concerning for GI process, especially as patient has never had an endoscopy. Repeat guaiac was negative ___. EGD showed evidence of gastritis / duodenitis but no e/o varices. # gastritis/duodenitis - As seen on EGD. Of note, gastric bezoar was seen on EGD, but as this is unlikely to be playing any role in her current symptoms, no role for further active management. - GI biopsies showed no abnormal findings - started PPI ",2271,714

","___ year-old female with PMHx of alcoholic cirrhosis and admitted to ___ on ___ with weight gain, increasing abdominal distension, and abdominal pain, found to have ARF, thought to be HRS. On admission to ___, due to concern for possible HRS and as no fluid was sent for analysis at OSH she had a diagnostic paracentesis that was very concerning for hemoperitoneum with bloody appearing fluid, RBCs 360,000 (not enough for spun Hct) with WBC 250 (past para RBCs ___, albumin less than assay. CBC in the morning had dropped 6 points so she was transfused an addition 1 U PRBC. CT abdomen performed and suspicious for hemoperitoneum; also notable for rectus sheath hematoma. Transplant surgery consulted, recommended MICU observation and continued transfusion support. She was transfused total of 3 units PRBC, 1 bag platelets, 3 units FFP and DDAVP. # Anemia of acute blood loss/Rectus sheath hematoma/hemoperitoneum: Bleeding from rectus sheath hematoma in setting of coagulopathy in combination with paracentesis may have contributed to blood loss. Notes suggest hematoma was present in ___ at previous hospitalization. Pt was given blood, FFP, DDAVP and platelets in the ICU with improvement and stabilization of hematocrit. Her hct remained stable at 34-35 on the floor without recurrence of hemoperitoneum. She completed 5 days of ceftriaxone for possible SBP (___). Subsequent paracentesis were done in spot marked by radiology in area with few collateral blood vessels. On CT ___, rectus hematoma was slightly smaller and ascites as of simple fluid density, with interval resolution of high density blood since ___ however paracentesis ___ still demonstrated high red cell count, although decreased from admission, indicating resolving hemoperitoneum. # Hypoxia: The patient required ___ liters of oxygen while in the ICU since being given multiple blood products for dropping hematocrit in the setting of renal failure and minimal urine output. CXRs showed atelectasis without PNA. Echo with normal systolic function, mod TR, RV dilation. Hypoxia likely ___ ascites, volume overload and atelectasis. She did not have any episodes of respiratory distress. The patient was taken out of bed. Her hypoxia resolved by the time she arrived on the floor without recurrence during the rest of her hospitalization. # Acute renal failure: Renal team considered pre-renal vs. ATN as etiology of her renal failure. Abdominal US without hydronephrosis. Hepatorenal a possibility, but a diagnosis of exclusion per ICU team. The patient had low UOP on the night of admission and was given lasix 80 mg IV with a fair response. Renal suggested albumin 25g BID in order to increase her oncotic pressure. UOP rose to ___ cc per hour on the day of transfer to the floor. On the floor, she was treated for hepatorenal syndrome and her Cr slowly improved (peak 4.0 --> 1.4). Albumin and octreotide were eventually stopped with continuation of midodrine given SBP 90's. Pt's creatinine increased again to 2.5 with fevers raising concern for worsening HRS in setting of infection. Renal was consulted, and felt that urinary sedimentation was most consistent with ATN although prerenal problems and HRS could contribute. She was Midodrine was continued and octreotide restarted. She again received albumin 25mg IV BID from ___ to ___ for HRS in setting of presumed SBP (see 'fevers' below). Her kidney function improved and Cr was 2.2 on discharge. She will require close outpatient follow up of kidney function and has labs ordered for ___ which will be followed up by her PCP. Her PCP can decide based on her Cr whether she can restart her diuretics. Her INR had also trended up during her hospitalization to 2.4. She was given 5mg p.o vitamin K prior to discharge for reversal and her INR should be followed up by her PCP on her labs of ___. . # Altered mental status: The patient had altered mental status on admission. Possible etiologies included hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and delirium due to metabolic causes. She was started on rifaxamin in addition to her lactulose. Her mental status improved on the day of transfer to the floor. She continued to have minor asterixis on the day of transfer, but was more alert and oriented. On the floor, her asterixis resolved and she remained AOx3 without recurrence of encephalopathy. She was continued on lactulose and rifaximin. # Alcohol induced hepatitis/hepatic cirrhosis - acute decompensation likely precipitated by relapsed alcohol abuse. Her LFTs improved since admission. Hepatic encephalopathy resolved. EGD ___ with erosive gastritis and portal hypertensive gastropathy but no varices. She was continued on lactulose and rifaximin. Diuretics were held given her renal failure and can be restarted as outpatient. Nadolol held as she was hypotensive and can be started as outpatient although she may not need it as no varices on most recent EGD (done prior admission ___. Of note, splenomegaly increased (13cm-->16cm) on CT from ___ to ___. Should be followed up as outpatient. #Fever- Pt had low grade fevers early in her hospitalization, attributed to alcoholic hepatitis. Cultures negative and fevers resolved. Later in her hospitalization (___), she again developed low grade fevers with Tmax 99.5-100. These were attributed to viral URI. Para negative for SBP ___ by cell count but given fevers, increased WBC in peritoneal fluid, and hemoperitoneum which is risk factor for infection, she began empiric treamtment SBP (started cipro 500mg BID (day 1= ___ with albumin x2. WBC in peritoneal fluid on ___ improved from ___ and cultures negative. On ___, she developed increased fevers with T 101-102 with new leukocytosis with left shift. ID was consulted and felt this was possible superinfection of her known rectus hematoma or hemoperitoneum. Antibiotics were broadened to vanc/flagyl/cefepime (day 1= ___. She was given albumin x2 on ___ and ___ for presumed SBP to prevent HRS. Imaging was negative for pneumonia, loculation in abdomen, or cholecystitis. Cultures were negative. Her fevers improved and leukocystosis and differential normalized. She was discharged on SBP prophylaxis with bactrim as she developed fever during treatment for SBP on cipro. # EtOH abuse. Actively drinking prior to admission. Later in hospitalization, pt denied drinking prior to hospitalization and stated she became ill because she was weak. Pt continued on MVI, folic acid and thiamine. Social work discussed alcohol use with patient. She will require close outpatient follow up for relapse prevention. # Liver mass and omental masses. Noted on a consult note from OSH. Sister has been told of this at OSH. Films from OSH and current studies were obtained and reviewed with radiology. These masses are not apparent on CTs (all without contrast) nor MRI in our system. AFP negative in ___. Pt will require MRI with contrast as outpatient to definitely evaluate this. # Rib fractures - Noted on imaging. Pt denies falls, trauma, abuse. Unclear chronicity. Pt will require outpatient follow up and BMD testing. . # Code: Full code (confirmed with patient ___ ",3404,1662

You had fallen and been taken to another hospital where there was concern for bleeding from the spleen. You underwent an abdominal/pelvis CT here which showed the damage to the spleen. Your blood counts were monitored and remained stable. You underwent a diagnostic paracentesis to check for infection in the fluid in your stomach. There was no evidence of infection. The liver doctors saw ___ and recommended draining fluid from your abdomen to improve your abdominal distenion so you underwent a therapeutic paracentesis the day of your discharge. It is very important that you stop drinking alcohol to prevent further damage to your liver. No changes were made to your medications. Continue your medications as previously prescribed. ","Ms ___ is a ___ year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented to an OSH s/p fall, found to have a splenic laceration and transferred here for further care. # Splenic laceration: Upon arrival she was hemodynamically stable. Radiology was unable to open the imaging on the OSH CD, so a non-contrast abdominal/pelvis CT was completed which showed a moderate-sized splenic laceration (although radiology was unable to tell if it was actively bleeding due to lack of contrast). Her Hct was trended and remained stable in the low 30' to high 20's. Transplant surgery was consulted and recommended conservative management. On discharge her Hct was 28.9. # Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of ESLD with history of encephalopathy and HRS. A diagnostic para was negative for SBP. She had ascites on exam and her diuretics were initially held in anticipation of a large volume paracentesis. She was given 50 gm albumin the day prior to discharge and the day of discharge had a large-volume paracentesis of 9 L of ascitic fluid and received an additional 50 gm of albumin. She will follow up with her hepatologist as an outpatient next week. She was continued on nadolol, a PPI, lactulose, rifaximin, and bactrim (for SBP prophylaxis). # Continued alcohol use: She was monitored on a CIWA scale, however did not display symptoms of withdrawal. She was continued on thiamine, folic acid, and a multivitamin. She was strongly encouraged to stop drinking do to alcohol's negative effects on her health. # Chronic kidney disease: The patient recently had HRS and has chronic renal insufficiency. Her creatinine on admission was 1.8 (the lowest value recorded in OMR for her recently). Her diuretics were held and she received albumin as described above and her Cr trended down to 1.3 the day of discharge. She was asked to restart her diuretics the day after discharge. # Code: She is full code. ",1696,452

You were admitted with an episode bloody bowel movement. CT scan showed colitis, which may have be infectious. You were seen by gastroenterology and will follow up with Dr. ___ in clinic. Medication changes: none ","# Colitis: Patient presented with one bloody bowel movement associated with crampy abdominal pain. CT showing acute colitis of descending colon. Differential diagnosis includes infectious (bacterial, viral, parasitic), ischemic, and inflammatory. Ischemic possible given high white count, acute nature and smoking history, however normal lactate. EKG with normal sinus rhythm. Infectious possible with high white count, however patient was afebrile and did not describe diarrhea or vomiting. Further, patient had no travel history, sick contacts or concerning food ingestion. First presentation of inflammatory bowel disease is possible, however less likely given acute nature and disease of only descending colon. Diverticuli seen on previous colonoscopy, however elevated white count and pain is not consistent with diverticular bleeding. The patient was started on ciprofloxacin for possible infectious etiology and given IV fluids. Gastroenterology was consulted due to concern for ischemic etiology. Stool studes were sent and were negative for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, vibrio and yersinia. C. difficile testing was not done as sample was unsuitable for testing (solid). GI recommended discontinuing ciprofloxacin and outpatient follow up given resolving symptoms with stable hemodynamics and recent colonoscopy. The patient was scheduled for outpatient follow up with gastroenterology. Chronic Issues: # T11/ T12 vetebral compression: Compression seen on CT scan. Patient has no current back pain with normal neurological exam. # Enlarged prostate: BPH, mildly symptomatic with stable PSA, and a relatively recent prostate biopsy, which was negative for malignancy.

No previous tracing available for comparison. ___ Hip X-ray Single AP view of the pelvis and AP and lateral views of the right hip were obtained. There is a comminuted fracture of the very proximal right femoral shaft with varus angulation of the proximal fragment and femoral head. No dislocation is seen. The pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints are not widened. There is diffuse osteopenia. Degenerative changes are seen in the visualized lower lumbar spine. Multiple pelvic phleboliths are seen. IMPRESSION: Comminuted fracture of the proximal right femoral shaft with varus angulation of the proximal fragment. ___ Hand X-ray AP, oblique, and lateral views of the left hand were obtained. There is diffuse osteopenia, which limits evaluation for subtle fracture. Given this, no acute fracture or dislocation is seen. Mild degenerative change at the first carpometacarpal joint and triscaphe joint are seen. AP, oblique, and navicular views of the left wrist were obtained. No definite acute fracture or dislocation is seen. There is diffuse osteopenia. Mild degenerative changes are noted at the first carpometacarpal and the triscaphe joint. IMPRESSION: Diffuse osteopenia, which makes evaluation for subtle fractures suboptimal, however, given this, no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. ___ Head CT There is no evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. Scattered periventricular white matter hypodensities are compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The gray-white matter interface is otherwise well preserved without evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct. The ventricles and sulci are proportionally enlarged consistent with age-related involutional changes. Vascular calcifications of the bilateral vertebral arteries and carotid siphons are incidentally noted. The extra-calvarial soft tissues show no evidence of trauma. The bony calvarium and skull base are intact without fractures. The mastoid air cells are well pneumatized. The ethmoid air cells, sphenoid sinus, and left maxillary sinus show evidence of sinus disease. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial process. 2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease and age-related global atrophy. 3. Ethmoid air cells, sphenoid sinus, and left maxillary sinus show evidence of sinus disease. ___ C-Spine: There is diffuse osteopenia which limits detection of subtle cervical fractures. No definite cervical fracture or acute malalignment is seen. There is loss of normal cervical lordosis with grade 1 anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and C4 on C5 with associated facet disease, endplate sclerosis, anterior osteophytes, and small posterior disc-osteophyte complex formation. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The atlantooccipital and atlantoaxial articulations are well maintained. The vertebral body heights are preserved. There is multilevel degenerative change predominantly in the form of cascading anterior osteophytes with posterior disc-osteophyte complexes, most prominent at C5-C6 showing marginal to moderate encroachment on the central canal. Multilevel facet disease and uncovertebral hypertrophy is also noted. The visualized lung apices are clear with minimal apical thickening or scarring. The thyroid gland is not completely visualized. IMPRESSION: 1. Diffusely osteopenic spine with no definite cervical fracture seen. 2. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and C4 on C5 is of indeterminate age, but given adjacent degenerative disease and associated facet disease, may be chronic. 3. Multilevel degenerative changes as detailed above with loss of normal cervical lordosis. CXR ___ Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is unfolded and calcified. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. The bones are diffusely osteopenic. ___ AP/ Lat Femur in OR Multiple views of the right proximal femur. Status post ORIF of the right femur with an intramedullary nail, hip screw, and interlocking screws. The fracture is in improved alignment. Total intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging time is 108.1 seconds. Please see operative report for further details. ___ Echocardiogram The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

You were admitted following a mechanical fall in which you broke your hip. During the operation, you suffered a small heart attack. We found on looking at the squeezing function of your hear that there were no lasting defects, although you likely have disease and narrowing in your coronary arteries. We made the following changes to your medications: STOP atenolol STOP Hyzaar STOP Naprosyn STOP KCL CHANGE ASA to 325mg daily from 81mg daily START Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg daily START Atorvastatin 80mg daily START Metoprolol 50mg twice daily START Vitamin D 800U daily START Calcium Carbonate 500mg three times daily START Lovenox until ___ for 2 weeks START Ciprofloxacin 250mg daily until ___ START Oxycodone/ Acetaminophen ___ twice daily for 5 days until ___. START Docusate 100mg Twice daily as needed for constipation for 7 days until ___. ","___ year old man with history of hypertension, Chronic Kidney Disease (stage 3), S/P mechanical fall with right subtrochanteric femur fracture transferred to ___ for worsening electrocardiographic ST depressions and rising troponins without chest pain following surgical repair of his hip fracture. # Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Per report, patient had initial small ST depressions on admission EKG in V3-V6, which became progressivly deeper following surgery with peak troponin-T to 0.12 and CKMB 12 (in setting of peak CK 702). Patient was loaded with Plavix and given IV heparin overnight initially with resolution of ST depressions the following day. Throughout the whole event, patient was free of chest pain. A follow up echocardiogram did not detect any wall motion abnormalities and showed an EF of >55%. The option of coronary angiography for risk stratification with ad hoc angioplasty if suitable to prevent re-infarction was broached with the patient, however, he consistently declined it under all circumstances. Accordingly, non-invasive risk stratification (i.e., stress testing) was not pursued, as he would not have agreed to coronary angiography even if the test showed large areas of myocardium at risk with residual ischemia. Patient was continued on aspirin 81 mg daily and prophylactic Lovenox 30mg q24h for total of 2 weeks (___). The decision was made to not use Plavix while the patient was on Lovenox, however, resuming Plavix for at least a month for post-MI secondary prevention should be considered by his primary care physician and new cardiologist. Patient was also started on Metoprolol 50 mg BID (stopping atenolol given his CKD) and atorvastatin 80 mg daily. # Right Subtrochanteric Femur Fracture: Now S/P Open Reduction Internal Fixation ___. Patient had NSTEMI following surgery which was asymptomatic. Patient was relatively pain free throughout the hospitalization and required a total of 2 tabs of oxycodone. Per ortho, patient was allowed to weight bear as tolerated and is to complete a two week course of Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. # Anemia/bleeding: The patient had a falling Hct after surgery (35.2 at presentation, nadir 27.5). This was felt most likely related to bleeding into his thigh. He also had guaiac (+) stools (but has an MCV of 89) and known external hemorrhoids. Patient was transfused a total of 6 units (1 prior to surgery and 5 post surgery over 4 days) as above with appropriate response. There was no evidence of bleeding based on the hip exam and lack of ecchymosis. Hct was stable at 36.7 on the day of discharge. # Leukocytosis: 19.7K, which fluctuated during the admission and was 12.9 at discharge. Patient was afebrile and without focal infectious findings. Most likely etiology is still stress response following surgery and NSTEMI. A urine culture was preliminary positive for GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S) 10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML at time of discharge (subsequently returned as Pseudomonas). Patient did have a Foley catheter during the hospitalization and was empirically begun on ciprofloxacin (to which the Pseudomonas was ultimately deemed to be sensitive). # Hypertension: Patient's home regimen was altered, taking off the Hyzaar and adding back HCTZ 12.5 mg daily. Patient was also switched from atenolol to metoprolol 50 mg BID. An ACE-inhibitor can be considered in outpatient setting for renal protection and secondary prevention post-MI when creatinine recovers. # Chronic kidney disease: Unknown baseline, but patient reports his creatinine has been elevated in past. FeNA calculated to be 0.43 indictating likely pre-renal component to the creatinine rise. Creatinine max was 2.3, at discharge he was 2.0. Medications were renally dosed, Hyzaar was held, and NSAIDs avoided. # Transitional: -Plavix 75 mg daily starting ___ with cessation of lovenox. -ACE inhibitor (patient with no known allergy) (or ___ if unable to tolerate an ACE-I) can be considered as an outpatient with stabilization of creatinine. -Urine cultures positive for ___ org/mL at time of discharge but patient asymptomatic.

He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. A radial duplex ultrasound was obtained as a radial artery graft was desired given his younger age. This revealed significant califications of the bilateral radial arteries and thus the decision was made not to use a radial artery for conduit. On ___, Mr. ___ was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to five vessels. As the greater saphenous vein was very small in the left leg, an extra length was harvested from his right thigh. Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He was transfused a unit of red blood cells for postoperative anemia. He remained in atrial fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone. On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The Physical Therapy service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. Anti-coagulation was initiated with Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. He was extremely sensitive to dosing and his INR rose to 5.2, nec3essitating an extra hospital day as the Coumadin was held and the INR fell to 3. Arrangements were made for his anticoagulation to be managed by his primary care physician. Follwoup appointments were given and medications and restrictions discussed. He had converted to sinus rhythm at discharge and Amiodarone will be tapered over the next 4 weeks. ",1941,357

You were admitted to the hospital because of right foot pain, which you have had in the past, and have had for many years. When you came to the emergency department, we thought that you may have had an infection of your foot, and we started you on antibiotics. After further evaluation, we believe that you have some inflmmation of your toe, by a condition that is called GOUT. Gout causes crystals to form in your joint, making them very painful. We started you on some medication which helps to reduce inflammation, and stopped your antibiotics. When you leave the hospital: - START Medrol Dose PAK as directed - STOP LEVOFLOXACIN 250 mg DAILY - START dextromethorphan-guaifenesin ___ mg Capsule: Take ___ Capsules twice a day for 5 days as needed for cough We did not make any other changes to your medications. It is very important that you RETURN TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT if the pain in your foot starts to get worse, or if you start to have worsening fevers or chills, as we have stopped your antibiotics. ","___ with CAD, AF on Coumadin, presenting with RLE pain and erythema . # Gout: The presumed diagnosis in the emergency department of the patient's RLE erythema and pain was initially cellulitis; he received IV doses of Vancmycin and Cefazolin in the ED, and was continued on IV Vancomycin on the floor. His WBC count was elevated at 11.4, and subsequently trended down with IV fluids in the setting of antibiotics. However, on examination the next morning, the patient was noted to have pain very specifically in the MTP joint of the right foot, with surrounding areas of erythema that were not tender to palpation. On further questioning, the patient indicated that he has pain in his bilateral MTP joints with pain roughly lasting ___ days twice a year, for nearly ___ years. The patient had a uric acid drawn back in ___ which was elevated at 7.5. The patient was treated with a one time dose of colchicine, but was not continued on this given his renal failure. He was discharged with a Medrol dose PAK to help reduce inflammation, with ___ with his PCP. Gout is also presumed to be the most likely diagnosis given that the patient had developed foot pain in the setting of Levoquin antibiotics for a presumed pneumonia. The patient was given very specific instructions to return to the ED if his pain or erythema were to worsen, given that he was being discharged off antibiotics. # Presumed Pneumonia: The patient's lungs sound CTA, in addition to a CXR which does not show any focal pneumonia. Per report the patient has been febrile at home, but has not been febrile in house. Patient does have a mild leukocytosis that has resolved, but which was presumed secondary to a gout flare. Levofloxacin was DC'ed. # Coronary Artery Disease: Continued on home regimen of ASA, digoxin, statin, and BB., and lisonpril # Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has an EF of ___. Continued on home regimen of ASA, digoxin, statin, and BB., and lisonpril # CKD: Stable with creatinine at 2.1. # Atrial fibrillation: Patient is rate controlled with digoxin and metoprolol. We continued his warfarin in house. # Pending Studies - ___ Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING x 2 # PCP ___ issues - Assess for improvement in RLE, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of gout ",2145,542

No other evidence of cholecystitis. ___ ECHO The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right atrium is moderately enlarged. The estimated right atrial pressure is >15mmHg. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness with a moderately increased/dilated cavity. The apex is aneurysmal. A left ventricular thrombus/mass cannot be excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed secondary to akinesis of the anterior septum and apex with focal apical dyskinesis, severe hypokinesis with focal basal akinesis of the inferior septum and inferior free wall, and hypokinesis of the anterior ftree wall and lateral wall. Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 27 %. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Dilated right ventricular cavity with low normal free wall motion. Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely lower due to the severity of tricuspid regurgitation. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with mildly dilated ascending aorta. The aortic arch diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is moderate [2+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate to severe [3+] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation. Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be UNDERestimated. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypetension. In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be UNDERestimated. There is no pericardial effusion. A left pleural effusion is present. Compared with the prior TTE ___, left ventricular ejection fraction is further reduced, with increased mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. EMR ___ CTA 1. 7 mm penetrating plaque in the distal portion of the aortic arch, without prior imaging for 2 studies acuity. A short-segment focal dissection in the mid aortic arch, appears chronic. 2. Signs of heart failure with cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions greater on the right, as well as gallbladder-wall edema. 3. Infrarenal aortic aneurysm and left common iliac aneurysm. Please note that the prior study was done without IV contrast however based on wall calcifications in overall diameter it is grossly unchanged. <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> Dear Mr ___ You were admitted to ___ because you had a small heart attack. You had extra fluid that caused weight gain. This is called heart failure. While you were here we gave you a medication to help you urinate more and remove fluid. What to do when you go home: * Please weigh yourself every daily. Do this in the morning after you go to the bathroom and before you get dressed. * If your weight goes up by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please call your heart doctor or your primary care doctor and alert them to this change. * We have made changes to your medication list, so please make sure to take your medications as listed below * You will also need to have close follow up with your heart doctor and your primary care doctor. It was a pleasure to take care of you. We wish you the best with your health! Your ___ Cardiac Care Team ","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with PMH significant for ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 27% on ___ ECHO), CAD ___ silent anterior MI of indeterminate age), permanent AF w/ CHB ___ BiV-ICD implant (on apixaban), CKD, hyperlipidemia who presented for chest/epigastric pain. He was found to have elevated troponins and decompensated heart failure. He was medically treated for NSTEMI with heparin drip and continuation of home medications including aspirin, statin, and beta blocker. He was diuresed with Lasix drip. He was also managed for ___ during this time, which was improving at time of discharge. While inpatient he had a reaction to likely hydralazine that resulted in a morbilliform drug rash. The drug was discontinued and his rash improved. Corresponding to that rash he had elevated LFTs that were downtrending by time of admission. He was found to have isolated hepatitis B antibody. # CORONARIES: CAD ___ silent anterior MI # PUMP: HFrEF (EF 35%) # RHYTHM: permanent AF and CHB ___ BiV-ICD ACTIVE ISSUES: ============== #Acute decompensated HFrEF (EF 35%) #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy #LBBB ___ CRT-D The patient presented with clinical evidence of volume overload with rales, elevated JVP, mild pulmonary edema on CXR, and congestive gallbladder and ascending colon on CT. BNP >50000. Diuresed on a Lasix drip at 10cc/hr. - Admission weight 51 kg, discharge dry weight 45.4 kg - Preload: 10 mg furosemide daily - Afterload: Imdur 90 mg daily (previous intolerance to ACE + he has hyperkalemia) - Neurohormonal blockade: metoprolol 50 mg XL - Digoxin was discontinued w/ supratherapeutic level, worsening renal failure, and stable cardiac function after diuresis #NSTEMI #CAD with prior silent MI Initial trop elevated with peak to 2.60, without clear new ECG changes. Unclear if initial presentation was Type 1 NSTEMI versus demand in the setting of severe decompensated CHF. He received 48 hour heparin drip, aspirin, and rosuvastatin. After discussion with the patient and family, it was determined that he did not desire any invasive intervention such as cardiac catheterization. He will continue on aspirin, rosuvastatin 20 mg, and metoprolol succinate 50 mg qD at home. ___ on CKD Baseline appears to be ___ and was at baseline at presentation, but increased to a peak of 3.4 with diuresis. It was not clear the etiology of his ___, but possibly prerenal in the setting of his low flow state. No urinalysis sediment evidence of ATN. No post-renal obstruction. Renal function was improving at the time of discharge, with creatinine down to 2.5. We did suspend apixaban for some time, but it was restarted once renal function improved. #Hyperkalemia Persistently hyperkalemic during the admission. Likely a combination of both diet and acute renal failure. Patient was found to have pile of bananas in his room. He likes eating them because they are soft. Patient and patient's family education on low potassium foods. He was not discharged on any potassium elevating agents at the time of discharge. His levels will need to be followed closely as ___ outpatient. # Transaminitis Mild transaminitis of unclear etiology. Initially thought to be due to vascular congestion, but has remained elevated even after diuresis. RUQ without evidence for cholecystitis. Possibly hypersensitivity to hydralazine, as LFTs increased after drug was introduced. Was also Hep B core Ig positive without Ag or Ab positive, which is nonspecific. LFTs were downtrending at time of discharge. Hepatitis B viral load pending at time of discharge. He should receive a fibroscan to follow up for possible cirrhosis secondary to possible chronic disease. # Morbilliform Drug Eruption Patient with erythematous itchy macular rash that started on back and thighs and since spread to abdomen anteriorly. Derm consulted, believes to be drug eruption, but unclear which drug. Patient started on hydralazine, furosemide, isosorbide mononitrite at the same time. Hydralazine was held at is was believed to be likely culprit, and rash improved. He was started on 14 day course of betamethasone steroid cream, per derm. #Ulceration of aortic arch #Aortic dissection Found on CT in ED. Cardiac surgery was consulted and recommended medical management with blood pressure control with systolic blood pressures < 120 mmHg. This should be continued as ___ outpatient. # Anemia Stable between ___ without any further acute drops. No evidence for hemolysis or active bleeding at this time. CHRONIC ISSUES: =============== #AF ___ BiV-ICD: Patient continued home metoprolol, as above, and will be able to continue apixaban for anticoagulation. He has a BiV-ICD in place.

He was intubated shortly after arrival to the ED for respiratory distress. While he was in the ED, his rhythm changed from sinus to a narrow complex tachycardia and ST segment elevations developed over the course of an hour on serial EKGs. He also had polymorphic VT during this time for which amiodarone drip was initiated. Code STEMI was called, he was given ASA and ticagrelor load and he was taken to the cath lab where he was found to have 95% distal LM disease, 100% ___ LAD stenosis with collateralization from RCA distribution, 40% ___, and 70% ostial RCA disease. No intervention was performed due to complexity and unclear goals of care; and impella CP was placed through right femoral access while heparin drip initiated; a Swan-ganz catheter was placed in the R femoral vein, and later on an A-line was placed in the right arm. Goals of care discussion was held, as the patient was previously DNR/DNI and PCI would put him at high risk for needing dialysis given his CKD; there was concern this would not be consistent with his goals as someone who preferred to avoid being in the hospital. The recovery process would additionally likely necessitate a long rehab stint. Meanwhile, he was treated broadly with vancomycin and Cefepime for fever, likely secondary to lung source. Due to his Impella he developed complications of hemolysis and hyperkalemia, so was temporized with IV insulin and dextrose. He was not making significant urine so Lasix was a poor option and dialysis was not within goals of care. Repeat family meeting was held discussing CPR, and it was decided that this would be against the patient's wishes. At that time, patient was made DNR and ICD was disabled. HCP wished to continue with medical management including impella and ventilator support until family was able to visit the patient. Overnight on ___, patient had increasingly downtrending MAPs and began alarming for low flow on the impella. Exam at that point in time was notable for R surgical pupil, L fixed dilated pupil, no corneal reflex, no gag or cough reflex, no withdraw to painful stimuli. Cardiac exam with very faint S1/S2 with weak carotid pulses. Patient was triggering spontaneous breaths on ventilator. Upon discussion with family at that time, the preference was to wait to discontinue life support until arrival of the daughter. After that conversation, patient then developed loss of all arterial pulsations on A-line and lost his pulse on exam. He also was noted to be asystolic on telemetry so all supportive measures were withdrawn. He was pronounced disease at 0405 on ___. Family members were immediately contacted and came to bedside. His HCP declined autopsy. ",2237,664

We believe the urinary retention was due to the recent increase in the ziconotide dose running through your pump. We were able to get administrative approval for the company who adjusts your pump settings to come provide their services in the inpatient setting, however they are able to visit you in your home to adjust the settings sooner. You will have additional nursing services to care for your new Foley catheter. Once your ziconotide dose is decreased, the Foley catheter should be removed to allow a trial of urination. If you are still unable to urinate, you should return to the hospital immediately. Our radiologists and pain specialists reviewed the CT images of your lumbar spine and we believe that the pain you are experiencing is due to the superficial placement of the pump catheter, which has some mild inflammatory changes around it. Please continue lidocaine ointment or patches and Voltaren gel to relieve the pain in that area until you can see a pain specialist who can manage this type of intrathecal pump. It was a pleasure taking care of you. Best wishes, Your ___ Care Team ","___ with chronic pudendal impingement syndrome s/p intrathecal pump for ziconotide infusion who was admitted for acute urinary retention and pain at intrathecal pump catheter site. #Acute urinary retention - Timing seems to coincide with recent increase in ziconotide dose on ___. ___ Pain service was consulted and recommended decreasing the ziconotide dose 20%, to previous dose. However, ___ Pain service only has equipment for ___ pumps and were not able to interrogate or adjust the Flowonix Prometra pump, which the patient has. Administrative approval was obtained for Pentec, the company who manages patient's pump in the outpatient setting, to provide services as inpatient. Given delay in ability of pump service agency to provide adjustment in the inpatient setting, patient was discharged with Foley catheter with plan for decrease in ziconotide dose as an outpatient, followed by Foley removal and voiding trial. #Acute pain over intrathecal pump catheter site - Developed over the ___ weeks prior to admission. CT L spine revealed no signs of infection. However, where catheter bends and overlaps the L2 spinous process is quite superficial and had some mild surrounding inflammatory stranding of the soft tissue. Per ___ Pain Service, this inflammation could be causing the pain. Pressure on the site over time from supine position (patient spends most of her time in bed due to debilitating pain) could explain the timing of the pain 6 months after pump was placed. The pain was partially relieved by lidocaine patches. Patient was discharged with lidocaine ointment and Voltaren gel. Dr. ___ at the ___ in ___, who placed the pump, was contacted by phone on ___ regarding this issue, and did not feel the catheter was causing the pain but was willing to see the patient in followup. He recommended that the patient find a local pain specialist in ___ who could manage the pump and the ziconotide but was unable to provide a referral to a specific specialist. ___ Pain was also unable to provide this referral as the Flowonix brand of intrathecal pumps is essentially never used in the ___ of ___. Patient will contact the vendor to request a referral to an appropriate local provider. #Chronic low back pain and pelvic pain: Patient has been debilitated by this pain for several years despite multiple procedures. Her current narcotics are managed by Dr. ___ ___ in ___ and her pump is managed by Dr. ___ ___ in ___. She was continued on her home pain regimen, which was confirmed per phone conversation with Dr. ___ on ___, with the exception of substituting regular release hydromorphone for her extended release hydromorphone due to it being non-formulary at ___. #Orthostatic hypotension: Pt had been having loose stools and decreased PO intake, likely due to a viral gastroenteritis. She was also on higher doses of hydromorphone at the beginning of the hospitalization for acute on chronic pain. The orthostasis resolved with IV fluids, weaning of narcotics, and improvement in her gastroenteritis. Stool studies were negative for infectious source. CHRONIC ISSUES: #HYPOTHYROIDISM: Continued levothyroxine. #HX OF HTN/CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA: Continued home Verapamil. #PSYCH: Continued home medications.

When that concluded though, she began a slow decline. She has had decreased appetite, a rapid 30 lbs weight loss and a few more falls. She complains of back pain and it is unclear whether pain or weakness has been the cause of her falls. She also became incontinent of urine, but not stool. Ultimately, 2 weeks ago when she could not even walk two steps she went back to the ED where Xrays were negative. She went to rehab. A CT was not done. At the nursing home rehab she continued to have pain and weakness with not much improvement. Last night the patient was much more quiet than usual. This AM she woke upset and in a lot of pain. She was screaming and refusing to take her medications. The daughter encouraged the rehab nursing home to send her to the ED. At the ___ ED she received a spine CT that revealed, ""Findings consistent with multiple myeloma involving multiple levels and an associated mass arising from T12 extending into the canal and compressing the thecal sac significantly."" Of note the patient can not have an MRI due to the aneurysm clips. A left toes fracture was also found on plain films. The patient was sent to ___ for further evaluation and treatment. In the ED now the patient is in some mild pain, but reports feeling ok. Of note a year ago the patient began a w/u for multiple myeloma. She had a biopsy done of the T12 lytic lesion that was inconclusive. She then had a bone marrow biopsy that revealed pre Kappa light chains, but no conclusive evidence of multiple myeloma.

There is evidence of prior avulsive injury arising off the medial malleolus and likely the lateral malleolus as well. There is chronic deformity of the lateral malleolus. No acute fracture is identified. There is calcaneal enthesopathy. Soft tissue swelling is noted. IMPRESSION: Moderate tibiotalar joint degenerative change. No acute fracture appreciated. ___ CT HEAD IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage status post right craniotomy and aneurysm clipping. 2. Hyperdensity of the left posterior cerebral hemisphere not corresponding to vascular territory could conceivably represent retained contrast related to the patient's recent myelogram. Attention on followup is recommended. 3. Stable bifrontal encephalomalacia. 4. Unchanged position of a right parietal ventriculostomy catheter. ___ TECHNIQUE: Thoracolumbar spine, five views. FINDINGS: The patient is status post posterior fusion from T10 through L2 with a T12 corpectomy including placement of a vertical fusion spacer. Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes are incompletely characterized, but suspected, along the facet joints along the mid through lower lumbar spine. Small anterior osteophytes are present along the lower thoracic spine. There is no evidence for hardware loosening. A PICC line terminates in the upper right atrium. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is also noted. IMPRESSION: Unremarkable post-operative appearance. ___ MRI SPINE IMPRESSION: Status post T12 corpectomy and T10-L2 fusion. Posterior and right-sided intraspinal fluid collection communicates through the laminectomy defect and causes anterior and left lateral displacement of the thecal sac. This leads to severe encroachment on the distal spinal cord. There are no findings to suggest tumor in this location. The signal intensity characteristics are typical of simple fluid, rather than hemorrhage. ___ 05: 14AM BLOOD WBC-22.1* RBC-3.39* Hgb-10.2* Hct-30.8* MCV-91 MCH-30.2 MCHC-33.3 RDW-17.6* Plt ___ ___ 12: 06PM BLOOD Neuts-83.9* Lymphs-8.5* Monos-7.3 Eos-0.2 Baso-0.1 ___ 05: 14AM BLOOD Plt ___ ___ 06: 45AM BLOOD ___ PTT-30.2 ___ ___ 05: 49AM BLOOD Glucose-113* UreaN-27* Creat-0.9 Na-138 K-6.6* (HEMOLYZED FROM PICC - falsely elevated) Cl-106 HCO3-28 AnGap-11 ___ 04: 10AM BLOOD ALT-16 AST-29 LD(LDH)-425* AlkPhos-60 TotBili-0.3 DirBili-0.1 IndBili-0.2 ___ 04: 10AM BLOOD Hapto-422* ___ 9: 01 pm URINE Source: Catheter. **FINAL REPORT ___ URINE CULTURE (Final ___: ESCHERICHIA COLI. >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair - advance per ___ recs. TLSO brace to be worn with any and all attempts at ambulation. <FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS> ___ <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You were admitted for surgery to remove a lesion in your thoracic spine, and then was transferred to the Neurology service for leg weakness after the surgery. This did get better with pain control and supportive care, and we did not find any othe reason for your new leg weakness. You likely have a condition called multiple myeloma. This will require radiation therapy for treatment, which have set up for you (see below). ","___ w/ h/o of stroke ___ years ago with baseline of expressive aphasia and RLE weakness, although family claims that she can fully comprehend. Pt was found to have T12 mass concerning for malignancy in ___, however bx of mass and BM was inconclusive. She was asymptomatic at that time and family decided not to persue further work-up. Pt now p/w with a 2.5 month h/o of progressive weakness and recurrent falls unresponsive to ___, and weight loss from 250-->225. Pt had CT at OSH which demonstrated expanding lesion at T12 and was subsequently given 10mg IV dexamethasone and transfered to ___ for further management. Patient arrived on the floor afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Immediate neurology and neurosurgery consults were obtained. Her hospitalization course is as follows: # T12 lesion: Patient has profound lower extremity weakness bilaterally, some of which is baseline from her previous CVA. Her right sided neuro exam is notable for hyperreflexia and clonus which is likely left over from her distant stroke. She was continued on dexamethasone and ISS while on the high dose steroids. The patient was also given a TLSO brace for ambulation (although initially in too much pain to ambulate), and the head of her bed was kept at <45 degrees. She received a pre-op myelogram, consistent with an expanding T12 lesion from prior imaging. She was subsequently taken for decompression surgery by Ortho-Spine Team (s/p T10-L2 fusion, T12 Corpectomy) and transferred to the Ortho-Spine service for post-op management for two days. When she returned to the medicine service on POD2, the patient was unable to move her lower extremities bilaterally. Ortho-spine service indicated that the patient required additional pain control. After consult with Neuro-Onc, the patient was transitioned from dexamethasone 10mg Q8 hours to dexamethasone 4mg BID on POD4. She was transferred to the Neurology service for better management of her leg weakness. It was felt this was likely due to post-op pain and inability for her to express her pain level due to her aphasia. Her medications were titrated and she did better on a higher dose fentanyl patch with immediate release morphine and tylenol for breaththrough pain. Subsequently her leg movements improved on better pain control. She will require XRT for her other bony lesions, and will need to follow up in ___ clinic after XRT (to be arranged by XRT). # FED/GI: Patient was found to initially have very mild hypercalcemia on admission. She was NPO for procedure and started on maintenence fluids overnight however did not require agressive IVF. At the time of surgery, her hypercalcemia resolved. She was advanced to a dysphagia diet post-operatively and did well on that for the rest of her course. Electrolytes were stable with the exception of potassium which kept returning falsely elevated from hemolosis when drawn off her PICC. # Foot Fracture: The patient was found to have R foot fracture involving the base of the fifth proximal phalanx with extension to the fifth MTP joint. This was consistent with repeat imaging at ___. Her L foot and ankles were also imaged because the pt was complaining of additional pain, however, films did not reveal any additional acute fractures. The feet were vascularly intact. Orthopedics recommended a hard sole boot for when the patient became ambulatory, otherwise, no intervention necessary. # Pain: Patient was found in extreme pain when transfered back to medicine service on POD2. Unclear of origin as patient has difficulty communicating due to her aphasia. Patient's pain was controlled with standing acetaminophen, oxycodone, oxycontin, fentanyl patch and dilaudid IV PRN. The pain team was also consulted to help manage her pain. She was able to come off the oxycontin on a higher dose of fentanyl patch, and had PO ___ oxycodone and tylenol for break through pain. # Encephalopathy: On POD2, there was noted an increase in aphasia, and confusion, which was difficult to assess given baseline communication issues. HCHCT for acute bleed was negative. The Pt was afebrile and infectious work-up including UA was neg. Urine Ctx and blood ctx were negaitve for occult infection. Her mental status improved with better pain control. She got a little worse on ___ and was subsequently found to have a new UTI (E Coli), which improved after treating with first ceftriaxone and then Bactrim when sensitivies returned pan-sensitive. # Hct Drop: The patient Hct dropped from 32 on POD1-->22 on POD2, Hemavac drained only 185cc, pt responded appropriately to 2U PRBC. Unclear where bleed is. Patients Hct subsequent remained stable after transfusion. A T&L MRI revealed: ""Posterior and right-sided intraspinal fluid collection communicates through the laminectomy defect and causes anterior and left lateral displacement of the thecal sac. This leads to severe encroachment on the distal spinal cord. There are no findings to suggest tumor in this location. The signal intensity characteristics are typical of simple fluid, rather than hemorrhage."" Her Hct remained stable and the ultimate source of her Hct drop was never identified but felt to be possibly due to post-op hemolysis. The fluid collection was discussed with ortho spine service who felt it could be conservatively watched for now (likely just post-surgical changes). # History of Stroke: The patient was continued on home dose of aggrenox until the time of her surgery. When the patient was transfered back to Medicine on POD2, the aggrenox was held. It was restarted on ___ at the consent of orthopedics team. # HTN: The patient was continued on home dose of losartan, diltiazem and atenolol # HLD: The patient was continued on her home dose of pravastatin # ID: UTI discovered ___eveloped foul smelling urine and WBC bumped to 22 (but this was felt to partially be due to her dexamethasone as well). Treated with first Ceftriaxone, then Bactrim, and culture grew out pan-sensitive E Coli. # Access: Pt had a PICC line placed and confirmed in good position early on in her hopspitalization. Due to initial concerns with dysphagia and patient frequently spitting out her meds, we decided to keep her steroids IV to ensure she received this crucial medication post-operatively. Once she has started radiation therapy, however, the PICC may come out and the IV steroids may be converted to the PO form. ",3141,1434

Per report, pt became increasingly agitated at her nursing home facility this afternoon, refused to go to radiation treatment so she was sectioned and sent to the ED for evaluation. On arrival the the ED, vitals were 97.7 65 133/67 18 100%. She was unable to say why she was in the emergency department. She denied any symptoms, including no chest pain, abdominal pain. No shortness of breath, cough, bladder or bowel symptoms. Her labs were notable for WBC 11.1, hct 32.5, cr 0.4, normal lytes. She had a UA with 10 WBC, no bacteria, small leuks, neg nit so she was given 1 dose of levaquin. Patient's daughter-in-law reports a more subacute decline in mental status, beginning most notably after her surgery in ___. She states that pt has been more agitated and confused since that surgery, though her symptoms have definitely worsened over the past few weeks to the point that her facility is having difficulty controlling her. Daughter-in-law has been told that pt's agitation is intermittently attributed to UTI, pneumonia, etc but she is frustrated that she does not feel that pt has improved at all despite treatment of multiple infections. In the past week, the patient has become physical with nursing staff. The daughter-in-law reports that pt has been hallucinating, seeing people and hearing voices over the past several weeks to months. Documentation from facility notes increasing paranoia. Psych was consulted at the facility and has been adjusting her seroquel dosing. It also appears that pt was treated for UTI recently with meropenem, last dose ___ with repeat culture from ___ at her facility negative. With regards to her MM, she has a long history of plasma cell disorder dating back to ___. Her evaluation at the time included bone marrow biopsy which showed ___ plasma cell, suboptimal core. FISH staining was negative for cytogenetic abnormalities, and since she had no other evidence of MM (no anemia, renal failure or hypercalcemia), she was managed with serial measurements of monoclonal proteins. However, in ___, pt suffered a fall and has been steadily declining since then with significant weight loss (at least 30 pounds), back pain, and urinary incontinence. She eventually had imaging that showed cord compression at the T12 level so she was transferred to ___ in ___, evaluated by neurology, neuro-onc and spine surgery and underwent T12 extracavitary corpectomy. Pathology showed plasma cells. MRI of C, T, L spine at the time also commented on marked heterogenous signal intensity which may be consistent with diffuse involvement of myeloma. Her post-op course was complicated by wound dehiscence necessitating surgical debridement and closure at the beginning of ___. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> SAH, s/p b/l Aneurysm clipping.

You were admitted for altered mental status and agitation. A CT head showed no evidence of a stroke or other acute changes. We attempted to obtain an MRI of the brain but you were not able to tolerate this. Neurology, oncology and psychiatry were consulted and all felt that your current mental status is either due to delirium (temporary confusion that is reversible) or a natural progression of your dementia. Delirium may be caused by steroids, recurrent urinary tract infections, or medication changes. As such, we began to taper your steroids. We also increased your dose of quetiapine and started you on anti-depressant called citalopram. For your multiple myeloma, please follow up with Dr. ___ at the appointment listed below for chemotherapy. You should be contacted at ___ House regarding completion of your radiation therapy. ","___ yo female with complicated past medical history who presents with subacute to acute altered mental status. . # encephalopathy: Per conversation with HCP, pt has not been herself since surgery in ___, though admittedly has gotten progressively worse since then and is now exhibiting aggressive behaviors at her facility, also concern for visual and auditory hallucinations, along with paranoia. Pt has had multiple medication changes recently, i.e. uptitrated seroquel, on and off antibiotics, also on narcotic pain medications. Pt also on steroids, which can cause AMS/psychosis. HCP also concerned that pt is depressed, which can certainly present as AMS in elderly. Neurology and psychiatry were consulted and both agreed encephalopathy likely ___ delirium and/or progression of underlying dementia +/- depression. CT negative for any acute processes. Given unlikely CNS infection or acute intracranial process given symptoms and time course held on LP and MRI. CXR negative. TSH, B12, folate all within normal limits. Oncology consulted and did not think CNS involvement of myeloma was likely (CNS myeloma extremely rare, especially in pt like Ms. ___ with limited disease burden). Per recommendations from neurology and psychiatry, we held her narcotics, increased seroquel to 25mg BID + 100mg qhs, and started her on citalopram 10mg daily. With permission from oncology and radiation oncology, we also initiated a decadron taper. Pt improved greatly with these measures. # UTI: Urine cx showed > 100,000 E coli sensitive to cipro and ceftriaxone, but not to bactrim. UCx also with unclear # of CFU of proteus. Attempted ceftriaxone IV, but pt would not tolerate IV. Now giving ceftriaxone IM. Chose to avoid cipro as this can worsen her encephalopathy. Pt to complete 5d course of CTX for complicated UTI to end on ___ # multiple myeloma: Pt received ___ tx of XRT today (___). Plan for 2 additional treatments, which have been scheduled. Pt will f/u with Dr. ___ in oncology re: initiation of chemotherapy. Family is aware that someone will need to accompany pt to appt with Dr. ___ to consent for chemo. # hyperglycemia: Secondary to decadron. Well controlled on sliding scale insulin with BG 115-175. # HTN: continued atenolol, diltiazem, losartan # HLD: continued statin # h/o CVA: continued aggrenox Transitional issues - UTI: on ceftriaxone IM as she could not tolerate maintaining an IV. E coli resistant to bactrim, sensitive to cipro but we avoided cipro as it could precipitate worsening encephalopathy. Pt should receive final dose ceftriaxone 1g IM in 2.1ml normal saline on ___ - encephalopathy: Increased quetiapine to 25mg BID during the day and 100mg qhs. Started pt on citalopram 10mg on ___. This can be increased to 20mg in one week. - multiple myeloma: Steroid taper. Pt received 3mg of decadron on ___ and will go to 2mg on ___. Dr ___ (___) should manage further tapering and management of decadron. Pt received ___ of 5 radiation treatments today (___). She should follow up with radiation oncology for remaining 2 treatments. She should also follow up with Dr. ___ at ___ listed below for initiation of chemotherapy. ",3235,769

Patient underwent ___ minutes of CPR (no epi or defibrillation per ED report) before ROSC was achieved. Initial rhythm during the event is unclear. Of note, she was in dialysis for 1 hour and only 140 cc were removed prior to event. Patient was subsequently transferred to ___ where she was started on heparin gtt for possible NSTEMI given ST depressions on EKG and initial troponin of 0.08. While at A-J, SBP dropped to 35 and patient went into rapid atrial fibrillation. 12-lead EKG showed a left bundle branch block, which she is known to have and occurs intermittently. Patient was subsequently cardioverted and received 2 L NS and IV digoxin, prior to returning to NSR At A-J, she underwent CT angiogram which did not show aortic dissection or pulmonary embolus. Patient was awake and talking and denied CP or SOB, though she endorsed significant ongoing back pain, which has been a chronic issue. BP subsequently improved with initiation of Levophed. Cardiology was consulted due to concern for posterior STEMI given EKG findings; posterior MI was felt to be unlikely and ischemic findings were thought to be ___ hypotension and severe AS. She was subsequently transferred to ___ for CVVHD and further management. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She endorses back pain. She endorses dyspnea on exertion prior to HD sessions, which is relieved following HD. Otherwise review of systems was negative.
